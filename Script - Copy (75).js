Prologue

The film begins with metal letters reading 'The Last Airbender'. As they fade away, a silhouetted figure appears, who bends a blob of water from the bottom of the screen. Cut to another figure, who lifts a piece of earth out of the ground and kicks it away. Cut to a third figure, who manipulates a stream of fire with his hands and blasts it at camera. Cut to the final figure, who twirls around and blasts air at the camera.
Cut to a text crawl, which is narrated by Katara.

Katara	[Narrating.] A hundred years ago, all was right with our world. Prosperity and peace filled our days. The Four Nations: water, earth, fire and Air Nomads lived amongst each other in harmony. Great respect was afforded to all those who could bend their natural element. The Avatar was the only person born amongst all the nations who could master all four elements. He was the only one who could communicate with the Spirit World. With the Spirits' guidance, the Avatar kept balance in the world. [Continues with single text on screen.] And then, a hundred years ago, he just disappeared.



Act I, The Boy in the Iceberg

A screen of text appears, reading Book One: Water with the waterbending symbol below. It fades to a scene of water swishing gently back and forth. The camera pans to reveal Katara practicing her forms on the edge of the ice. She eventually levitates a small sphere of water out of the ocean and plays with it gently before accidentally tripping and sending it flying down off-screen. Sokka leaps up from off-screen, soaked from the impact.

Katara	I'm sorry. I'm sorry! Hey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry ...
Katara	I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Hey! It worked better that time.
Katara	I thought about Mom. Isn't that strange?
Sokka	Yeah. I guess so. Just stop doing that stuff around me. I always get wet.
Katara accompanies Sokka on a hunt for food for their tribe.
Katara	[Narrating.] My brother and I live in the Southern Water Tribe, which was once a big city. Our father is off fighting in The War. My mother was taken prisoner and killed when I was young. In this time of war, food is scarce. My brother and I often go hunting for food, but, unfortunately, my brother isn't the best hunter in the world.

Sokka follows the tiger seal tracks, leading them out to the vast open field of ice

Sokka	Tiger seal.
Katara	Are you sure?
Sokka	I did everything Dad said to do. I watched which side of the fin tracks are more indented. That shows which direction they're going. I saw how long the drag skids are. That shows you how fast they're going.
Katara	There's something under there.
Sokka uses his boomerang to crack the floor open but the cracks expand and start a cave-in.
Sokka	It's a cave-in! Move away from the cracks.

A large ice sphere emerges from the cracks with a silhouette of a person inside it.

Sokka	Katara, don't go near it. This is probably some Fire Nation trick. Just back away really slow.

As Sokka turns around, Katara grabs his boomerang and uses it to crack the sphere.

Sokka	Katara! Do not hit that sphere!

The ice sphere breaks part, shooting a bright light high to the sky, which catches the attention of Prince Zuko on a faraway ship

Zuko	Uncle, look!

In the resulting ice crater, Katara and Sokka slide down to discover a thirteen-year-old boy, Aang, alive but exhausted, with his large six-legged bison creature, Appa.

Katara	Is he breathing?
Sokka	Did you see that light shoot into the sky?
Katara	What's your name? How did you get here? How did you get in the ice? [The boy turns toward Katara but is too tired to speak.] He's exhausted. [To Sokka.] We need to get him back to the village.
Sokka	[Pokes around Appa, who is still sleeping.] What is this thing? [Appa's tail accidentally lands on top of Sokka.] It's trying to eat me!

Aang is taken back to the village where he soon recovered in an igloo. Appa follows them home off-screen, much to the amazement of the villagers

Villager	Look. See?

Katara enters the igloo where the boy was recovering. As he puts on his shirt, Katara sees the tattoos on his back

Katara	How'd you get all the way out here?
Aang	I ran away from home. We got in a storm. We were forced under the water of the ocean.
Katara	Oh, I see.
Aang	It wasn't very smart. I was just upset. Thanks for saving me.
Katara	Lucky.
Aang	I probably should get home. They'll all be worried.
Katara	You're not still upset?
Aang	Not as much as I was.

Outside, Zuko's ship smashes through the icy landscape toward the village. Sokka later leads a train of children into the igloo

Sokka	The Fire Nation is here.
Katara	What?
Sokka	And they brought their machines.

Katara was heading out of the igloo with Sokka, then turned to Aang

Sokka	Don't come out till I tell you it's safe.
Aang	Is something wrong?
Katara	No. Please wait here.

Zuko enters the village with his men.

Zuko's soldier #1	Hurry, now!
Zuko's soldier #2	Secure the area.
Sokka	It can't be coincidence that we break him out of the ice, light shoots into the sky and now the Fire Nation is here with their machines.

Sokka reaches for his boomerang behind him, about to use it against Zuko.

Katara	Sokka, don't.

Zuko takes off his helmet before addressing the villagers.

Zuko	I am Prince Zuko ... son of Fire Lord Ozai and heir to the throne! Bring me ... all your elderly!
Child villager	Papa!
Zuko's soldier #3	Move!
Villager	Yeah?
Katara	Grandma!
Villager	Please don't ... don't harm him!
Zuko's Soldier	Come on!
The soldiers then took out several elderly villagers, including Kanna, the grandmother of Sokka and Katara. Furious, Katara was about to use her waterbending.

Sokka	Katara, don't.
Zuko's soldier #4	Form a line
Zuko's soldier #5	Come on!
Zuko's soldier #6	Here.
Villager	Hey.
Child villager	Grammy!

One of the soldiers finds Aang in the igloo with some children. Upon noticing his tattoos, he is brought to Zuko. Zuko is astonished to find the tattoos that he seemingly recognized its significance.

Aang	You're scaring these people.
Zuko	Who are you? What's your name!?
Aang	I don't need to tell you anything.
Zuko	Firebenders! [Zuko's soldiers move into positions.] I'm taking you to my ship. If you don't come, I'll burn down this village.
Aang	I'll go with you. Don't hurt anyone.

Aang follows Zuko and his men to the ship. The villagers move closer when a firebender sends out flame over their heads. Sokka and the villagers duck. They helplessly watch Aang being taken away. Cut to the igloo.

Sokka	They were looking for someone old and they were looking for someone with the same markings the boy had.
Katara	They dragged Mom away the same way when we were babies. She wouldn't have watched us being taken away. She would have fought. We found that boy. He's our responsibility. We should fight. What would you do if they tried to take me away?
Sokka	I'd kill them all.
Katara	Why?
Sokka	Because you're my sister. Because Dad told me to protect you with my life.
Katara	Because I'm your responsibility. And this boy is our responsibility.
Sokka	What do you want us to do, Katara? How are we supposed to save him? They're on a ship. We'd need a miracle to catch them. I know you think everything's going to work out, but I don't.

Appa wails louder and louder. When Sokka and Katara hear the sound of laughing children, they immediately go outside to see what is going on. The bison creature floats in the air as if wanting to follow his master, but is held back out of concern of the children hanging dangerously off his feet.

Katara	His bison creature thing floats.

Zuko's ship moves across the icy waters. Aang is kept in a room. The door opens, and Iroh and Zuko walk in. Iroh is amazed to see a young surviving airbender.

Aang	What do you want with me?
Iroh	My nephew wants me to perform a little test on you.
Aang	What kind of test?
Iroh	I assure you, it won't hurt. I've performed it hundreds of times. It only takes a few moments. And then you're free to go. Would you mind if I put a few things in front of you at the table? It will only take a moment.
Aang	That's all you want?
Iroh	My name is Iroh, and you have my word.

Cut to Sokka and Katara in the igloo with Katara's grandmother, Kanna.

Katara	Grandma, I know you're gonna try to stop us, but this is just something I need ...
Kanna	Sit down. [They sit.] I knew from the first time we discovered you were a bender, that one day, I would realize your destiny. There hasn't been a waterbender in the Southern Water Tribe since my friend Hama was taken away. Today, I found out that destiny. Did you see that boy's tattoos?

Sokka and Katara nod.

Kanna	Tattoos like that haven't been seen in over a century. I believe they are airbending tattoos.
Katara	How can that be?
Kanna	I believe that little boy might be the Avatar. [Pulls out a map of the world.] Once, a long time ago, the Spirit World kept balance over us.
Katara	What is the Spirit World, Grandma?
Kanna	It's not a place made up of things you can touch. But it exists, nonetheless. It is filled with the most amazing forms of dazzling creatures ... that exist in the most exotic valleys, mountains and forests. Each of these creatures is a Spirit. They've watched over us since the beginning. They have guided us. And only the Avatar can go speak to them.
Katara	Aren't there Spirits here?
Kanna	Yes, there are some Spirits that live hidden among us, sure they're watching us with great sadness ... the Fire Nation doesn't wish to live by the Spirits. That's why they're so frightened by the existence of the Avatar.
Katara	What can he do?
Kanna	With his mastery of the four elements, he will begin to change hearts. And it is in the heart that all wars are won. Now, go help this boy. He will need you two. And we all need him.

Zuko's uncle, Iroh, conducted a few test on Aang, after assuring him the test would be painless and once complete, he would be free to go. The test involved a candle flame that seemed to be drawn toward to him, a poured water that formed a circle on the table and a smooth rock that stood on an unstable position.

Zuko	You are my prisoner ... airbender. I'm taking you back to the Fire Nation.
Aang	You said ...
Iroh	I apologize. I should have explained further. If you failed the test, as all others did, you were free to leave. But, as it turns out, you are the only one in the entire world who could pass this test. It is truly an honor to be in your presence.
Zuko	Don't even try to escape. This is a warship ...!
Aang leaps over the table and over Zuko and Iroh, then lands behind them. He propels himself backward with airbending through an open door.
Zuko	Stop! There's no way you can ...
Aang uses airbending to close the door, trapping Zuko and Iroh inside as it can only be opened from the outside. The three guards outside se Aang then approach slowly to capture him. Aang pins them against the well with airbending, then goes to the upper deck, grabbing his staff along the way. Out in the open sea, he looks around, then sees Appa landing at a distant icy cliff
Zuko manages to get out of the holding room and came to the upper deck with his men. Aang spun around and turned his staff into a glider.

Zuko	Don't move! You have nowhere to run!

Aang then races across the deck to the bow of the ship, chased by Zuko and his men.

Zuko's soldier #7	Halt!
Zuko's soldier #8	Don't let him escape!
Zuko's soldier #9	Get him!

Aang jumps off the bow. Instead of a splash in the ocean, he appears gliding up to the cliff as Zuko and his men watch in amazement. Aang reunites with his bison creature, with Katara and Sokka.

Aang	Thanks for bringing Appa to me. The Fire Nation is up to something. I have to go back now.
Sokka	We'll come with you.
Aang	I can take you back to the village.
Katara	We're going with you.

Appa flies off the cliff, out of range as Zuko watches in despair.

Iroh	You found the Avatar.
Zuko	For a moment, I had my honor back.
Iroh	Your destinies are tied, Zuko. That, you can be sure of.



Act II (a), The Avatar Returns

Katara	[Narrating.] Aang flew us to his home. He told us how he left there in a storm on Appa, and got forced into the ocean where they almost drowned. Aang airbent a sphere around them, and ice formed. And he couldn't remember anything after that.

Aang, Sokka, and Katara arrive at the Southern Air Temple on the high mountains.

Aang	Hey, Chinto! Monae! I'm back! Hey, guys! I want you to meet someone!
Katara	This is where you live?
Aang	They must be playing some trick or something. Monk Gyatso is gonna try and jump out and scare me at any moment. He's the teacher responsible for me. [Jumps down.] He's kind of like my father.
Katara	Is it okay if you tell me your name?
Aang	The monks named me Aang. [Leads them into the Temple area.] Okay, guys! Enough!

A flying lemur flies toward Aang.

Sokka	Spider rat! They're poisonous! Get behind me.
Aang	He's a flying lemur-bat. We keep them as pets.
Katara	Weren't they extinct a long time ago?
Aang	Extinct? No, there must be thousands of them on this mountain.
Katara	Your friends were monks?
Aang	I know where they are right now. They're at the prayer field.

Aang races across the player field, goes down a flight of steps.

Katara	Aang, wait! I have to talk to you!

Aang is shocked to see human remains and an unkempt field.

Katara	Aang ... I think you were in that ice for almost a hundred years. The firebenders started a war.
Aang	I left a few days ago.
Katara	Aang, the Fire Nation knew the Avatar would be born into the Air Nomads ... so they exterminated all the Air Nomads.
Aang	[Words echoing through the entire area.] You're lying! [Finds a necklace on one of the remains.] This is Monk Gyatso's. I made it for him.

Aang has flashbacks to when he first gave the necklace to Gyatso.

Aang	Nooooooooo ...!

In his rage, his eyes and tattoos glow pure white and strong winds begins to circle around him, lifting him up.

Sokka	Katara! Stay away from him!

Aang is in trance and enters the Spirit World.

Sokka	[Echo.] Katara! Stay away from him!
Katara	[Echo.] Your friends were monks?

Aang walks into a cave. While looking around inside, a head of a dragon pops out from the mist.

Dragon Spirit	The Avatar? Where have you been?
Katara	[Echo.] Aang! You can't bring Monk Gyatso back, but Sokka and I can be with you as long as you need! Don't give up! We can do this together! Aang.

Aang leaves his trance and exited Spirit World. Aang opened his eyes. Katara was behind him.
Zhao spots Zuko on his ship out in the sea.

Zhao	The banished prince. Let's offer him lunch.

Cut scene to the mess hall on the Zhao's ship. Zuko and Iroh sat with Zhao on the main table, in front of Zhao's men in the hall

Zhao	I wanted to thank the great General Iroh and young Prince Zuko for dining with us. As you know, the Fire Lord has banished his son, the prince, and renounced his love of him, and will not let him return to the throne unless he finds the Avatar. The Fire Lord believes his son is too soft, and by doing this, he will become strong and become a worthy heir to the throne.
Zuko subconsciously bends a flame from a candle on the table. Iroh notices this, then holds his hand to calm him down.
Zhao	I commend the Fire Lord's discipline. For example, it seems I need to remind Prince Zuko that, during his banishment, he is an enemy of the Fire Nation and is not allowed to wear the Fire Nation uniform. But we will let him wear it today, like a child wearing a costume.
Zuko	[Stands up and whispers to Zhao.] One day, my father will take me back and you will bow before me.

Zuko storms off the mess hall. Iroh stands up and follows him. Back on his ship, Zuko gazes at his family picture (his mother, his father, his sister and himself) before has begins his training of firebending and hand-to-hand combat with four firebenders. Iroh observes from the deck above, while drinking his tea.
Appa lands in a forest in the Southern Earth Kingdom, where Katara, Sokka and Aang set up camp. Momo, the winged lemur, has become. Aang sits alone making sense of what he saw at the temple and the Spirit World.

Katara	You okay?
Aang	I'll be fine.
Katara	You know, my grandma thinks because you're an airbender, that you could be the Avatar.
Aang	How much does the Fire Nation control?
Katara	A lot of villages in the Earth Kingdom, like around here. They haven't been able to conquer big cities, like Ba Sing Se, but they're making plans, I'm sure.
Sokka	So ... are you the Avatar, Aang?

A young boy bursts out of the woods and seeks refuge with the trio from the Fire Nation soldiers chasing him.

Sokka	What is this?
Katara	Stay hidden.
Lead Fire Nation soldier	That child is being arrested.
Katara	For what?
Lead Fire Nation soldier	He was bending tiny stones at us from behind a tree. It really hurt.
Katara	He can bend earth?
Lead Fire Nation soldier	Earthbending is forbidden in this village.
Katara	Leave him alone. You're not taking him anywhere.
Sokka	No one ... is taking anybody away!
Katara pops open her water pouch and bends the water at the soldiers.
Lead Fire Nation soldier	She's a bender!

The water traps Sokka's arms and chest in ice instead, much to his frustration.

Sokka	Katara!

The soldiers arrest Sokka, Katara, Aang and the young earthbending boy. As they are taken to the prison camp just outside a village, Aang notices the poor condition of the village and its people. They are shoved through a gateway of a tall metal fence.

Fire Nation Prison guard	Move. You, too.

In the prison yard, there are men on the ground, weary and defeated. The earthbending boy has reunited with his father.

Earthbending boy	Dad!
Earthbending boy	This is my father.
Earthbending father	Hello.
Sokka	That's the Fire Nation's plan, suppress all other bending.
Aang	How did this happen to your village?
Earthbending father	Fire Nation sent soldiers. We fought them and defeated them. Then they sent their machines, huge machines made of metal. There was nothing we could do. Those who could not bend were allowed to live in peace, if we were imprisoned.
Aang	Earthbenders! Why are you acting this way? You are powerful and amazing people! You don't need to live like this! There is earth right beneath your feet. The ground ... is an extension of who you are!

The earthbenders are dismissive and non-responsive

Aang	If the Avatar had returned ... would that mean anything to you?
Earth Kingdom prisoner	The Avatar is dead. If he was here, he would protect us.
Aang	My name is Aang ... and I am the Avatar. [Unhoods himself to reveal his airbending tattoos.] I ran away, but I'm back now. It's time for you to stop doing this!
Fire Nation prison guard	The Avatar would have to be an airbender. Are you an airbender, boy?

Katara angrily pushes the soldier away.

Katara	Leave him alone!

The prison guard was furious, then tries to grab Katara, but Aang uses airbending to push him away

Fire Nation head prison guard	How is he doing that?
Aang	I don't want to hurt anyone.
Fire Nation head prison guard	All airbenders should be dead. Kill him! Firebenders, positions!
Sokka	Okay! Everybody can help us now!

The earthbending boy throws a pebble behind the lead soldier; he turns and bends a flame from the nearby fire pit at the boy. The father raises an earth barrier to protect his son. The other earthbenders watch the event unfold and rise with renewed sense of hope.

Katara	Don't be afraid!

Seeking to restore order, the lead soldier with another firebender launches a large flame toward the father and the boy, but it is blocked by a larger barrier, which six earthbenders raise in unison. Another earthbender raises a rock and accelerates it at the other soldier, and earth-blocks a flame attack from the lead soldier. Sokka takes down the lead soldier while Aang takes out another. After a few more airbending moves from Aang and a boomerang attack thrown by Sokka, the remaining soldiers retreat. Outside the prison, Aang takes out a few more soldiers in the village. After everything is settled, the villagers break open a shed holding all tools related to bending.

Old man of Kyoshi Town	They took away any tools related to bending.

Momo goes in the shed and knocks over a waterbending scroll. A villager picks up the scroll and gave it to Katara.

Kyoshi villager	The Fire Nation took this scroll from a member of your Water Tribe.
Katara	A waterbending scroll. This is rare. My mom told me about these.
Aang is taken to the statue of Avatar Kyoshi
Old man of Kyoshi Town	This was you when you were born an earthbender, two lifetimes ago. You came to our village. Avatar Kyoshi loved games.
Aang	I do, too. I mean, I still do.
Aang later met with Sokka and Katara.
Sokka	A lot of the villages in this part of the Earth Kingdom are occupied by the Fire Nation, like this village was. They prey on the weakest towns and villages. We should go visit some of these towns, Aang.
Aang	I need to tell you something.
Katara	What is it, Aang?
Aang	I ran away before they trained me to be the Avatar. I don't know how to bend the other elements.
Katara	Why did you run away?
Aang	The day they told me I was the Avatar, they said I could never have a normal life, that I could never have a family. They said it cannot work with the responsibilities of the Avatar.
Katara	Why can't the Avatar have a family?
Aang	I asked that! They said that's the sacrifice the Avatar always has to make.
Sokka	Okay. So, what if we found you teachers. Teachers to teach you bending? Which element would you have to learn first?
Aang	Water. Water comes after air in the cycle. Air, water, earth, fire.
Sokka	But there are really powerful benders in the Northern Water Tribe. My dad told me about it before he left. It's led by a princess because her father died. There are teachers there, but all the way on the other side of the world.
Aang	We can get there on Appa.
Sokka	That's what I was thinking. And maybe we can stop in the villages on the way, start a change in The War in these small villages. Should we try it?
Aang	Yes, we should.

The team of Aang, Sokka, Katara, Momo and Appa, set out on the journey to the north. Along the way they visit the villages, where Aang announces the Avatar had returned. In villages that were still occupied by Fire Nation soldiers, Aang uses his airbending to defeat them and liberate the village from their grip.
Meanwhile, Zuko and two soldiers, disguised as travelers of the Earth Kingdom, visit the first village Aang liberated. They also enter the former prison camp and look around.



Act II (b), The Blue Spirit

Katara	[Narrating.] The scroll we had was proving to be helpful. Aang was practicing, but for some reason, he was having trouble with waterbending. We moved from town to town in the Earth Kingdom. We tried to stay out of sight, but Sokka became concerned we were being followed.

On Zhao's flagship, a soldier enters the war room and whispers some information to Zhao. Later, at the Fire Nation palace, Zhao meets with Ozai.

Zhao	Sire, I have good news. As you know, I conducted a raid on the Great Library, which most said didn't exist.
Ozai	Get on with it.
Zhao	I found scrolls in the library. We are deciphering them. But I believe they may contain information as to where the Ocean and Moon Spirits live in this world. With this information, we could bring down the Northern Water Tribe city, we could show the world the true strength of fire.
Ozai	I am pleased. Well, Commander Zhao, are the rumors true or not?
Zhao	Our spies have discovered someone claiming to be the Avatar. They describe him as just a boy. We should set a trap for this person. We have many Earth Kingdom people under our control. I can leave soldiers hidden in certain locations.
Ozai	And my son?
Zhao	He had his chance. He missed it.
Ozai	Let's hope, for your sake, my son doesn't find this person first and he turns out to be the Avatar. He would return as a hero and, for all purposes, be your superior.
Zhao	Well, I suppose it's a race, then.

At the Fire Nation Colony Fifteen located in the Northern Earth Kingdom, Zuko sat with his uncle Iroh sat in a tea shop, with his face hidden by the hood of his cloak to avoid being recognized.

Zuko	We're close, Uncle. They've been moving farther and farther north. We're catching them.
Iroh	There are a lot of pretty girls in this town, Zuko. You could fall in love here. We could settle down here, and you could have a blessed life. We don't have to continue this, Zuko.
Zuko	I'll show you why we must, Uncle. Hey. Hey. Little one, come here.
Zuko	You look like a very smart boy. Tell me what you know about the prince, the Fire Lord's son.
Teahouse Child	He did something wrong.
Zuko	He spoke out of turn to a general, in defense of some of his friends who were going to be sacrificed in a battle.
Teahouse Child	Then Prince Zuko was sentenced to an Agni Ki duel, but when he showed up, it was his father he was to fight.
Zuko	That's right.
Teahouse Child	He would not fight his father.
Zuko	Then his father mocked him and said, "I should bring your sister up here to beat you."
Teahouse child	Then the father burnt his son ... to teach him a lesson. [Leaves.]
Zuko	[Turning to his uncle.] We'll catch him soon, Uncle. Then we can think about the pretty girls.
At the shore of a sparking lake beside a forest, Katara and Aang practiced waterbending while Sokka tended to a campfire nearby.
Katara	Aang ... try to keep your wrist bent, like it's showing.
Katara	What's wrong? You've really been distracted today.
Aang	I saw Sokka's maps. We're near the Northern Air Temple. Do you think it would be okay if I just visited there and came back? I'd be back in less than a day.

Later, Katara filled in Sokka in on what Aang wanted to do.

Sokka	Why?
Katara	He had a vision at the Southern Air Temple prayer field. He talked to a Dragon Spirit who he thinks can help us. He thinks if he goes to another spiritual place, he can get back to the Spirit World.
Sokka	I don't think that's a good idea. We started a rebellion. Try to talk him out of it.

Aang continued practicing waterbending in the dark, while Sokka and Katara were sleeping. He managed to raise the three short pillars of water. As he closes his eyes concentrating, ripples and waves began to form on the lake. He remembers Gyatso giving lessons to him and the other students in the open field and then images of skeletal remains he saw earlier. When he opened his eyes, he was surprised to see the result of his lack of control over waterbending.

Aang	I can't do this. I need help.

Convinced that Aang needed help immediately from the Dragon Spirit, he woke up Appa to head over to the Northern Air Temple. Sokka and Katara woke up and saw him took off. She assured Sokka that Aang will back in a day, but Sokka was concerned the Fire Nation might catch him.

Sokka	I guess your talk didn't work.
Katara	He'll be back in a day.
Sokka	The Fire Nation is following us. If we make a wrong move, they'll catch him.

Appa lands at the Northern Air Temple. As Aang makes his way in the temple ruins, he finds an old man.

Old man in temple	Who are you? Why, it cannot be! I've heard stories. Are you?
Aang	My name is Aang.
Old man in temple	I cannot believe I've lived to see your return. I'm an earth villager, but I visit these temple remains often.
Aang	The Fire Nation destroyed this temple. They have ruined everything.
Old man in temple	No, no, no, not everything. You know, there's a hidden chamber of statues I think you, of all people, should see. [Leads Aang to a hidden chamber of statues of past Avatars.] These are all the Avatars. These are the reincarnations of you over the years. The Avatar Roku was your last life. Now, how did the airbenders know you were the Avatar, little one?
Aang	They gave me a test. They put 1,000 toys in front of me and asked me to choose four. They said I chose the same four objects that belonged to the previous Avatars. That's when they told me I could have no family. Told me I had a responsibility to the Four Nations. There's a ceremony when everyone bows to me. That's when I accept my role as the Avatar. But when everyone bowed ... I didn't bow back.
Old man in temple	You seem like a nice young man. You really do. You will forgive me, won't you?
Aang	For what?
Old man in temple	For luring you down here.

Confused, Aang turns to see him surrounded by Fire Nation archers hiding behind the statues.

Old man in temple	I have lived in poverty because of your absence, Avatar. So you will understand my actions today.
O
ther Fire Nation soldiers poured into the chamber – one of them passed the old man a pouch of money as a reward. Unable to escape, Aang resigned himself to surrender.
Aang is later hung from chains in a prayer room in the Northern Air Temple. Aang closes his eyes and entered the Spirit World.

Old man in temple	[Echo.] I have lived in poverty because of your absence, Avatar.

Aang finds his way back to cave and meets the Dragon Spirit again.

Dragon Spirit	I have seen a vision of the moon turning red. The Fire Nation has stolen knowledge of us from the Great Library. They are planning to misuse this knowledge.
Aang	I will stop them.
Dragon Spirit	You must go to the Northern Water Tribe. If they take that city, more will suffer and die, as your airbenders have. You must go now
Aang	Will I stop them?

Aang is forcibly pulled from the Spirit World, being woken up by Zhao.

Zhao	Wake up, young man. My name is Commander Zhao. I set this trap for you. Don't worry, I'm not gonna kill you. Besides, you'd just be reborn again, and then the search would continue. So where have you been all this time? And how is it that you're still a boy? I understand that when you freed that handful of towns, you were very impressive, but ... you only used airbending against my soldiers. Now, why is that?

Later, a Fire Nation tank rolls on the bridge that connects to the temple. A blue-masked figure hitches a ride by grabbing onto its undercarriage. Zhao addresses his assembly of soldiers in the courtyard.

Zhao	The Fire Lord and I have a plan to ensure our reign and the downfall of our enemies. I am sending a personal message to the Fire Lord, informing him that the once feared Avatar is our prisoner and no threat to our might.

The figure heads toward the prayer room, stealthily taking down the soldiers posted along the way there. He enters the prayer room.

Aang	Who are you?

The figure pulls his dual swords about the strike.

Aang	Wait! Don't ...!

The figure severs the chains. Aang falls down on the floor and holds up his chained hands.

Aang	Stop!

The figure cuts the cuffs off Aang's hand. He gives Aang's staff back then motions Aang to follow him. Zhao and his assistant head toward the prayer room when he discovers the downed soldiers.

Zhao	Fools.

His assistant quickly runs back upstairs to alert the other soldiers.

Zhao's assistant	Close the inner gates! The Avatar has escaped!

Aang uses airbending to knock two soldiers block his path. He enters the temple courtyard with the blue-masked figure, referred by the soldiers as the Blue Spirit. They are surrounded by many Fire Nation soldiers.

Fire Nation soldier #1	Lock down the gate!
Fire Nation soldier #2	Lock down all the gates!

A fire attack from behind forces them to evade and split up, fighting the soldiers on the opposite sides on the courtyard. Aang ends up in the practice area.

Fire Nation soldier	To the main post!
Aang	This was their practice area.
Fire Nation Soldier	Go again!

Aang uses the airbending practice area to take out the soldiers, then leaps out of the courtyard and ran on the stepping pillars that the soldiers are unable to follow. Aang prepares to fly out using his staff-glider but seeing the Blue Spirit still fending off the soldiers by himself, Aang flies back to fight alongside him.

Zhao	Do not kill the Avatar! He will just be reborn again!

The Blue Spirit quickly grabs Aang and threateningly holds his sword at Aang's throat.

Zhao	Why are you doing this? Who are you?

Zhao notices a human mouth behind the blue mask.

Zhao	Open the gates. Let them out.

The soldiers remained at the courtyard while the Blue Spirit led Aang across the bridge. Zhao head up on a high balcony.

Lead Archer	Is it some kind of Spirit, Commander?
Zhao	Not at all. [Turns his head to the Lead Archer.] Do it.

At the end of the bridge, Zhao's archer shoots down the Blue Spirit with single arrow. The soldiers rush across the bridge to capture them. Aang discovers the unconscious Blue Spirit was Zuko. He uses airbending to pull in the fog and mask their getaway.

Zhao	What is this?

Once the fog clears, Aang and the Blue Spirit are nowhere to be found.
Aang takes care of Zuko till the next morning, then left Zuko still unconscious by the camp-fire in the forest, leaping from tree to tree.

A few days later, Zhao arrives at the Fire Nation palace, being summoned into the throne room.

Ozai	And how did he escape?
Zhao	I fear that your son is not only incompetent, but also a traitor. Of course, I cannot prove this, sire.
Ozai	You think ... my son is this person the soldiers are calling the Blue Spirit.
Zhao	Yes.

Back in the Northern Earth Kingdom, Iroh relaxes and receives a foot message from an earth villager woman when Zuko walks past him.

Iroh	Zhao's men were searching the coast, looking for you. They also searched the ship. I told them you went on vacation with a girl. Where were you for the past four days?
Zuko	Nowhere. We have to keep moving. The Avatar is traveling again.
Iroh	Take rest first. It looks like you went through a great deal. When you wake, we'll have tea together before we start the engines.
Ozai	[Voice-over.] Do not harm my son. Leave him to his isolation.
Zhao	[Voice-over.] You have my word, sire. I will not harm him.

As Zuko lay down on his bed in his ship, he notices something hissing near the torch on his wall. Zuko dashes out just before the ship explodes into a huge, orange fireball. Iroh moves in to protect the woman from the blast as he cries out to Zuko.

Iroh	Zuko!

Cut to Appa (carrying Aang and the others) swimming toward the Northern Water Tribe.

Ozai	[Voice-over.] And what of the Avatar?

Cut back to Ozai's throne room.

Zhao	We assume he has rejoined with his supporters. It has been confirmed that he's traveling north. It is my strong belief that he is traveling to the Northern Water Tribe.

Aang and the others find waterbenders practicing in the open water. Sokka waves at them. They are led to the city of the Northern Water Tribe.

Zhao	[Voice-over.] I believe the child Avatar has only knowledge of his birth element, air. I believe he is trying to learn in the discipline of water. He's gone to seek out someone in the Northern Water Tribe, where they have lived beyond our reach and openly practice waterbending.

Aang and the others are led into the city, the entranced seals shut behind them with waterbending.



Act III, The Siege of the North

Katara	[Narrating.] We arrived at the Northern Water Tribe. We presented ourselves to the royal court. My brother and the princess became friends right away. Aang showed them he was the last airbender, and was accepted to train with the master. The city knew our arrival would bring great danger. And they prepared for war they knew would come in the ensuing weeks.

Pakku lays out their defense strategy to Yue, with Sokka by her side.

Pakku	The city was designed to withstand any assault. If we keep them to the courtyard and the marketplace till night falls, where we have the advantage, we will succeed. If we let too many of them into the city, their sheer numbers could overwhelm us. As many fires in this city should be put out as possible when the alarm sounds. We want to minimize their bender sources. I must assign a guard to be with you at all times, Princess. Your presence is our inspiration.
Sokka	I'll do it. That's me. I'll be her guard. Nothing will happen to her.
Pakku	I had a feeling you might volunteer.

At the Fire Nation palace.

Ozai	I've heard no word of my son for quite some time. Do you know where he is?
Zhao	I've not heard of anything, sire. I'm sure word of him will come to us soon.
Ozai	The Northern Water Tribe benders are given their strength by the Moon and Ocean Spirits. They will be difficult to defeat. Now, if for some reason the Spirits were not involved, that would be different. What have you learned from the stolen scrolls?
Zhao	We have deciphered the location of the Moon and Ocean Spirits.
Ozai	It is our destiny ... to have found this information, Zhao. Eliminate the Spirits. Take the city and we will have thwarted the Avatar in the process.

The Fire Nation fleet is later seen leaving the ports, heading out to the city.
Katara and Aang has attend a waterbending class taught by Pakku.

Pakku	Water is what?
Students	The flowing element. The element of change.
Pakku	To master water, you must release your emotions, wherever they may lead you. Water teaches us acceptance. Let your emotions flow like water. [To Aang.] Aang, would you like to spar? You haven't sparred in a few days.

Pakku encases Aang in an icy prison; Aang gracefully waterbends the ice away. Pakku sends him three water balls, which Aang successful catches in mid-air and disperses.

Pakku	Now, use offense, Aang

Aang attempts an offensive move as instructed, but he only manages to raise droplets of water and inadvertently raises the waters in the nearby canals. Aang stops, realizing his still lack control over his incredible waterbending ability, as Pakku and the students watch in astonishment.
On the Fire Nation flagship that leads the rest of fleet, Iroh meets with Zhao on the upper deck.

Zhao	General Iroh, I'm glad you could accept my invitation to join us on this historic event.
Iroh	Your invitation was most gracious.
Zhao	You are a gifted strategist. No one can argue that. Your failure in the Hundred Day Siege of Ba Sing Se won't be held against you. Your son died in that siege, didn't he?
Iroh	Yes, he did.
Zhao	Again, I offer my condolences on your nephew burning to death in that terrible accident.
Iroh	Thank you.

Sokka and Yue spend some time enjoy each other's company.

Yue	I've loved spending these weeks with you, Sokka.
Sokka	Me, too.
Yue	Should we see what the ocean is doing today?

They head over to the fort walls for the ocean view.

Yue	When there is some safety for all of us, I will come visit our sister city in the Southern Water Tribe and spend some time in your home.
Sokka	That would be great. But I warn you ... my grandmother will ask you a lot of questions.
Yue	What might she ask me?
Sokka	She'll say, "Why is your hair white, young lady? You look very odd."
Yue	I would say to your grandmother, my hair is white because when I was born, I was not awake. My mother and father could not get me to make a sound or move. So they prayed for days to the Moon Spirit and dipped me into the sacred waters. My parents said that my hair turned white then and life poured into me.
Sokka	Wow. You didn't tell me that.
Yue	You didn't ask me. Only your grandmother did.

Iroh went below deck and met with Zuko, who was still alive.

Iroh	I'm sure Zhao was the one who ordered the attack on you.
Zuko	Any problems?
Iroh	We have arrived at the Northern Water Tribe's stronghold. They believe the boy is there.
Zuko	Why do you seem upset, Uncle?
Iroh	Zhao has no sacredness. Are you sure you want to be here?
Zuko	I will not be allowed to live in peace until I bring the Avatar to my father! Is that not clear to you?

Aang and Katara practice their waterbending forms when the black ashes fall all over the city.

Yue	[Confused.] What is this?
Sokka	Yue ... the Fire Nation is here.

The ashes came from the burning engines of the Fire Nation ships. At the rear of Zhao's flagship, Zuko wearing a white camouflage suit stepped into a small boat.

Iroh	Now be sure to keep your uniform closed up to your neck. And remember, your Chi can warm you.
Zuko	I know, Uncle.
Iroh	Be safe.

Zuko heads out near the shore of the stronghold, then dive in. He finds a spot underneath the city with thin layer of ice, then generates heat from his chi to melt the spot and breaks through the surface, into an unoccupied room.
Sokka takes Aang into the balcony room, to see Yue, who oversees the Fire Nation armada with Katara.

Katara	Aang needs to ask you something.
Aang	I have to talk to the Dragon Spirit. He can help me defeat the Fire Nation. Is there a spiritual place where I can meditate?
Yue	There is a very spiritual place. The city was built around this place. But we must hurry.

Yue leads Aang, Katara, and Sokka to the place. Zuko notices them from the rooftops, and follows them to an entrance into the side of a icy hill. Inside, they step into a spiritual cave with an oasis pond. In the middle of the pond is a tree with a ground path leading to it. Momo reaches into the pond to touch one of the two fish, one black and the other white.

Aang	Momo, be nice.

Momo scampers and flies away.

Aang	To get your airbending tattoos, you have to meditate for long periods of time without losing focus. Some of the great monks can meditate for four days.

As Aang sits down to meditate near the tree, two fish swirl together in a circle and glow in their insides.

Yue	I have to get back.
Sokka	I'll take you.
Katara	I'll stay with him.

Sokka escorts Yue back while Katara stays with Aang as he meditates into a trance.

Katara	Aang? Aang, can you hear me? I knew you were real. I always knew you'd return.
Zuko	Me, too.
Katara	The Fire Lord's son. You took him from our village.

Zuko sets his torch down to set the grass on fire, as Katara takes a defensive stance. Zuko sends out a fire blast, which she takes out with two large stream with water from the pond. With the second blast, Katara takes it out with a single stream. Zuko is surprised and impressed of her waterbending ability.

Zuko	Who are you?
Katara	My name is Katara, and I'm the only waterbender left in the Southern Water Tribe.

Zuko then firebends a curved blast and a straight blast. Overwhelmed with the complexity of Zuko's attack, she deflects the curved blast but is knocked hard against the tree with the other blast.
As the large city bell was rung, the Northern Water Tribe residents hurriedly seek for shelter all over the city. Soldiers were seen lining up on the fort walls, overlooking the large Fire Nation fleet nearing its attack range. As Pakku gives out the battle cry, the soldiers rattled the end of their spears against the icy floor for morale.

Water Tribe civilian #1	Go for the children.
Water Tribe civilian #2	Yes.

Zuko rests Katara's unconscious body next to the tree and checks her condition.

Zuko	I'm not allowed to go home without him.

Northern Water Tribe soldiers and waterbenders are seen lining up on the fort walls, overlooking the large Fire Nation fleet nearing its attack range. As Pakku gives out the battle cry, the soldiers rattle the end of their spears against the icy floor for morale.
Iroh enters the war room on Zhao's ship.

Iroh	The waterbenders get power from the moon. They will get stronger as the day comes to an end.
Zhao	General Iroh, I've been keeping a secret.
Iroh	And what is that?
Zhao	In my raid of the Great Library earlier this year, I found a scroll that tells the location of the Ocean and Moon Spirits.
Iroh	To meet a Spirit would be a great honor.
Zhao	Well, I hope I can give you that honor.

The Fire Nation invasion of the Northern Water Tribe stronghold was fully underway. A firebender riding Komodo-Rhino stepped off the ship's platform and scaled up the icy fort walls. At the top, the firebender uses the fiery metal spheres catapulted from the ship to blast the city below. Spinning drills break through the surface at many locations within the city, where soldiers emerge from the sea below.
Sokka came back to the spiritual place with Yue, and found Katara lying unconscious near the tree. He woke her up.

Sokka	What happened?
Katara	Prince Zuko's here in the city. He took Aang again.

Elsewhere, Zuko places Aang down in a storage room in the stronghold, still in trance with his hands bound with rope. Zuko peers out the window, looking down the battle taking place below.

Zuko	We'll just wait till everyone's fighting everyone. Then in the night, we'll slip out.

Back to the point when Aang entered the Spirit World

Katara	[Voice-over.] Aang, can you hear me? I knew you were real. I always knew you'd return.

Aang sees the lanterns which leads him back to the cave again.

Aang	Hello! Hello! [Enters the cave and finds the Dragon Spirit inside.] Please, tell me how to beat the Fire Nation!
Dragon Spirit	You are not dealing with the loss of your people, and your responsibility for their deaths. You are stopping yourself from grieving. You are angry. You must let this go. As the Avatar, you are not meant to hurt others. [Slithers past Aang and out of the cave, but then peers back at Aang.] Use the ocean. Show them the power of water. Go! Do this now.

The Dragon spreads its mighty wings and lifts itself into the sky, as Aang leaves his trance.

Zuko	[Voice-over.] My sister Azula was always the special one. She was a firebending prodigy.

Aang finds himself hand bound in the storage room, and overhears Zuko talking while he is still looking out the window.

Zuko	My father loves her. He can't even look at me sometimes. He says I'm like my mother.

Aang takes off, leaping over barrels, with Zuko chasing right behind him. He firebends the flames from the torches to take Aang down, in the process blasting away items in the room.
Just outside the stronghold, a firebender concentrates a large flame through a nozzle on a ship to breach the fort wall. He succeeds in creating a hole, which is large enough for Fire Nation soldiers and Komodo rhino-riders to freely enter the city. Master Pakku waterbends the soldiers in the courtyard. Cut back to the flagship.

Iroh	I advise that you pull back your men soon. They will be trapped in the city when the moon's power comes out.
Zhao	Do not worry about the moon's power, General Iroh.
Iroh	Why should you not be worried about the moon's power?
Zhao	Because your brother, Fire Lord Ozai, and I have decided it is in our best interests to kill the Moon Spirit.
Iroh	What?

Zuko searches for Aang hiding in the storage room. His hands now free, Aang uses airbending to distract Zuko and tried to escape. The situation escalates to a fight, later with firebending and airbending.
Katara follows Sokka and Yue back into the city, with the battle ongoing.

Katara	Calm down. We'll find him.

Katara then sees the flames illuminating from the window of the storage room from the city below.
As the fight between Aang and Zuko turns into a standoff, they notice that room is rumbling. The water in the barrels begin to shake, then spirals to Zuko encasing him in ice. Aang turns to see Katara, who completes her waterbending move.

Katara	Are you okay? Did the Spirits tell you anything?
Aang	Yes. The Dragon Spirit talked to me. I know what to do.
Katara	Aang, we have to go.

Katara then left the room with Sokka and Yue. Aang peered out the window was astonished at the battle in the city. Before leaving the room, he melted the ice around Zuko's head so Zuko can breathe.

Aang	You won't be killed by waterbenders if you stay hidden here. [Walking to the doorway, he turns toward Zuko.] We could be friends, you know.

Zhao and Iroh enter the Water Tribe stronghold through the breach, flanked by Fire Nation soldiers. He uses the scroll from the Great Library to lead his men and Iroh to where they need to go.

Zhao	They're getting stronger. This is a scroll from the Great Library. This is our map. Our world is going to change soon, gentlemen.

Some soldiers approach the civilians.

Fire Nation soldier	Right there and right there.

The soldiers step back, seeing Appa growling at them.

Elsewhere, Aang heads toward the courtyard with Sokka, Yue and Katara, when he notices Zhao heading somewhere with the scroll in his hand.

Aang	See where they're going! I'll go join the fight!

Aang joins the fight in the main courtyard. Meanwhile, back at the storage room, Zuko uses his chi-heat to melt the ice and free himself. Elsewhere, Zhao and Iroh end up at the same spiritual place where Aang meditated.

Zhao	They are called many names: Yin and Yang, "push" and "pull". May I introduce you to the mysterious Ocean and Moon Spirits? [Scoops the white fish into his pouch.] Why do Spirits take the form of such benign things? It leaves them so vulnerable.
Iroh	To teach man kindness and humility.

Zhao prepares to kill the Moon Spirit.

Iroh	Commander Zhao, there are certain things humankind should not tamper with. The Spirits and the Spirit World is one of them.

Just then, Katara, Sokka, and Yue burst into the spiritual place.

Yue	What are you doing here?
Iroh	Stop, Zhao. The world will go out of balance. Everyone will be hurt.
Zhao	The Fire Nation, is, too powerful ... to worry about children's superstitions, General Iroh.
Iroh	Commander Zhao, don't.
Zhao	We are now the gods!

Zhao overcomes his hesitation and stabbed the fish with his dagger.

Iroh	No!

Yue collapses onto the grass, as if she was the one who was struck. Outside, pain shoots through Aang's head. The moon slowly turns red, casting a sickly crimson glow over the Northern city. The waterbenders lose their Moon enhanced powers.

Fire Nation soldier	All men, battle stations!

Cut back to the spiritual place.

Zhao	You are too soft, General Iroh.

In rage, Iroh creates large fires from his hands.

Fire Nation soldier	He's making fire out of nothing!

Zhao, unable to comprehend or combat this great power, turns and flees from the spiritual place, along with his men. Iroh lowers his hands and his flames die down and disappear.
With the Moon power gone, more Fire Nation soldiers pour into city through three breaches now made on the fort walls.

Water Tribe soldier	They're breaching the wall!
Water Tribe soldier	To the front!

Aang looks at the losing battle surrounding him, as the Dragon Spirit's words are heard again.

Dragon Spirit	[Echo.] As the Avatar, you are not meant to hurt others. You must show them the power of water.

At the spiritual place, Yue and the others grieved for the loss of the Moon spirit.

Yue	All is lost.
Iroh	You have been anointed by the Moon Spirit.
Yue	He gave me life when I was a child.
Iroh	Then there is still a chance. You can give your life back for the Spirit's.
Sokka	Don't listen to him, he's Fire Nation.
Iroh	Nothing is ever truly lost.
Yue	Is it mine to give back, if I choose?
Iroh	There are reasons each of us are born. We have to find those reasons.
Yue	This was the reason I was born.
Sokka	Yue, please.
Yue	There is no love without sacrifice.
Sokka	Yue, what are you doing? You don't know what will happen.
Yue	I believe my life force will leave my body and return to the Moon Spirit.
Sokka	And then what?
Yue	My soul will no longer exist in this form.
Sokka	Please don't do this. There must be another way. I can't let you do this. I'm supposed to protect you.
Yue	My people are dying, Sokka. Those who are in charge of others have a responsibility. It is time we show the Fire Nation we believe in our beliefs as much as they believe in theirs.
Sokka	But Yue ...
Yue	I'm scared. Don't make me any more scared. I will miss you more than you know.

She gives Sokka a final kiss and enters the pond. As her life force leaves her to revive the Moon spirit, her white hair turns black. There is a pause in battle when the Moon reverts back to its natural glow. Iroh lifts her lifeless body out of the pond and lays her down on the grass. Distraught, Sokka cries over her lifeless body.
Zhao is on a bridge, seemingly in despair of his failure of killing the Moon, when Zuko steps out from the mist, walking toward him.

Zhao	I killed you.

Zuko prepares to duel Zhao when Iroh appears.

Iroh	Come away from him, nephew. There are too many soldiers now. They will never let you take the Avatar. We must leave immediately. He wants to fight you so he can capture you, Zuko. Walk away. [Zuko stands his ground, staring at Zhao with deadly intensity.] Come!

Zuko turns and walks back toward Iroh. As they walk away, the enraged Zhao bends a large double-spiral fire attack to them. Iroh quickly steps in front of Zuko and redirects the flames to sides, shielding him and Zuko.

Iroh	You stand alone. And that has always been your great mistake.

They leave Zhao standing alone on the bridge. The flames had attracted the attention of four waterbenders, now blocking Zhao's path off the bridge. Outnumbered, Zhao had no way of escaping and no chance of defeating them, especially with the return of the Moon's power. Refusing to surrender, Zhao provoked the waterbenders by bending a fire shot that barely hit any of the waterbenders. He then took off his cloak and waited to be finished off. Four large stream of water bent from the river below engulfed Zhao into a water sphere, drowning him.
Aang races toward the fort wall, using waterbending to trap and stop Fire Nation soldiers along the way. He sends an airbending blast through the courtyard, opening a path through the battle forces, leading him right to the wall. At the top, he looks out at the vast Fire Nation fleet in the ocean.

Pakku	[Voice-over.] Water teaches us acceptance. Let your emotions flow like water.

He recalls images of his life with Gyatso and his friends, and then the fateful event where everyone bowed to him but ran away instead of bowing back. Freeing himself of his guilt, Aang used with the Ocean's power to push a massive body of water up against the fort wall, and Moon's power to pull it toward the sky. His eyes and tattoos glowed bluish-white as he unleashes "the power of water". The battle paused again at the incredible feat of waterbending. The Fire Nation soldiers in the city tried to retreat through a breach but it was blocked by the water. Aang bent the water toward the Fire Nation fleet but kept it hovering threateningly above them. Knowing that the water could easily crush the fleet, the Fire Nation accepted defeat and turned away. Aang bent the water back into the ocean and watched the fleet in retreat.

Katara	Aang?

Katara hugs Aang as he was cheered from the city below. She and Sokka help an exhausted Aang down the stairs into the courtyard. Aang sees the entire Northern Water Tribe waiting for him. They all kneel and bow before him. The remaining Fire Nation soldiers left in the city also bow, in awe of his power and moved by his show of mercy.

Katara	They want you to be their Avatar, Aang. We all do.

Katara and Sokka bow alongside the others. Finally accepting his role as the Avatar, Aang bows back.



Epilogue

The story closes with Ozai's exposition at the Fire Nation place, directed to his daughter Azula, who kneels before him.

Ozai	Our forces in the Northern Water Tribe have failed to take the city. General Zhao was killed in battle and my brother has become a traitor. My son's proven himself a failure. Now, Sozin's Comet is returning in three years. It will give all firebenders the ability of the highest firebenders, the ability to use their own Chi to create fire. That is the day we will win this war and prove the Fire Nation's dominance. Now you must stop the Avatar from mastering earth and fire. You must give us the time to get to that day. Do you accept this unspeakably important task I'm putting in your hands?
Azula	I do, Father.





Prologue

The film begins with metal letters reading 'The Last Airbender'. As they fade away, a silhouetted figure appears, who bends a blob of water from the bottom of the screen. Cut to another figure, who lifts a piece of earth out of the ground and kicks it away. Cut to a third figure, who manipulates a stream of fire with his hands and blasts it at camera. Cut to the final figure, who twirls around and blasts air at the camera.
Cut to a text crawl, which is narrated by Katara.

Katara	[Narrating.] A hundred years ago, all was right with our world. Prosperity and peace filled our days. The Four Nations: water, earth, fire and Air Nomads lived amongst each other in harmony. Great respect was afforded to all those who could bend their natural element. The Avatar was the only person born amongst all the nations who could master all four elements. He was the only one who could communicate with the Spirit World. With the Spirits' guidance, the Avatar kept balance in the world. [Continues with single text on screen.] And then, a hundred years ago, he just disappeared.



Act I, The Boy in the Iceberg

A screen of text appears, reading Book One: Water with the waterbending symbol below. It fades to a scene of water swishing gently back and forth. The camera pans to reveal Katara practicing her forms on the edge of the ice. She eventually levitates a small sphere of water out of the ocean and plays with it gently before accidentally tripping and sending it flying down off-screen. Sokka leaps up from off-screen, soaked from the impact.

Katara	I'm sorry. I'm sorry! Hey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry ...
Katara	I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Hey! It worked better that time.
Katara	I thought about Mom. Isn't that strange?
Sokka	Yeah. I guess so. Just stop doing that stuff around me. I always get wet.
Katara accompanies Sokka on a hunt for food for their tribe.
Katara	[Narrating.] My brother and I live in the Southern Water Tribe, which was once a big city. Our father is off fighting in The War. My mother was taken prisoner and killed when I was young. In this time of war, food is scarce. My brother and I often go hunting for food, but, unfortunately, my brother isn't the best hunter in the world.

Sokka follows the tiger seal tracks, leading them out to the vast open field of ice

Sokka	Tiger seal.
Katara	Are you sure?
Sokka	I did everything Dad said to do. I watched which side of the fin tracks are more indented. That shows which direction they're going. I saw how long the drag skids are. That shows you how fast they're going.
Katara	There's something under there.
Sokka uses his boomerang to crack the floor open but the cracks expand and start a cave-in.
Sokka	It's a cave-in! Move away from the cracks.

A large ice sphere emerges from the cracks with a silhouette of a person inside it.

Sokka	Katara, don't go near it. This is probably some Fire Nation trick. Just back away really slow.

As Sokka turns around, Katara grabs his boomerang and uses it to crack the sphere.

Sokka	Katara! Do not hit that sphere!

The ice sphere breaks part, shooting a bright light high to the sky, which catches the attention of Prince Zuko on a faraway ship

Zuko	Uncle, look!

In the resulting ice crater, Katara and Sokka slide down to discover a thirteen-year-old boy, Aang, alive but exhausted, with his large six-legged bison creature, Appa.

Katara	Is he breathing?
Sokka	Did you see that light shoot into the sky?
Katara	What's your name? How did you get here? How did you get in the ice? [The boy turns toward Katara but is too tired to speak.] He's exhausted. [To Sokka.] We need to get him back to the village.
Sokka	[Pokes around Appa, who is still sleeping.] What is this thing? [Appa's tail accidentally lands on top of Sokka.] It's trying to eat me!

Aang is taken back to the village where he soon recovered in an igloo. Appa follows them home off-screen, much to the amazement of the villagers

Villager	Look. See?

Katara enters the igloo where the boy was recovering. As he puts on his shirt, Katara sees the tattoos on his back

Katara	How'd you get all the way out here?
Aang	I ran away from home. We got in a storm. We were forced under the water of the ocean.
Katara	Oh, I see.
Aang	It wasn't very smart. I was just upset. Thanks for saving me.
Katara	Lucky.
Aang	I probably should get home. They'll all be worried.
Katara	You're not still upset?
Aang	Not as much as I was.

Outside, Zuko's ship smashes through the icy landscape toward the village. Sokka later leads a train of children into the igloo

Sokka	The Fire Nation is here.
Katara	What?
Sokka	And they brought their machines.

Katara was heading out of the igloo with Sokka, then turned to Aang

Sokka	Don't come out till I tell you it's safe.
Aang	Is something wrong?
Katara	No. Please wait here.

Zuko enters the village with his men.

Zuko's soldier #1	Hurry, now!
Zuko's soldier #2	Secure the area.
Sokka	It can't be coincidence that we break him out of the ice, light shoots into the sky and now the Fire Nation is here with their machines.

Sokka reaches for his boomerang behind him, about to use it against Zuko.

Katara	Sokka, don't.

Zuko takes off his helmet before addressing the villagers.

Zuko	I am Prince Zuko ... son of Fire Lord Ozai and heir to the throne! Bring me ... all your elderly!
Child villager	Papa!
Zuko's soldier #3	Move!
Villager	Yeah?
Katara	Grandma!
Villager	Please don't ... don't harm him!
Zuko's Soldier	Come on!
The soldiers then took out several elderly villagers, including Kanna, the grandmother of Sokka and Katara. Furious, Katara was about to use her waterbending.

Sokka	Katara, don't.
Zuko's soldier #4	Form a line
Zuko's soldier #5	Come on!
Zuko's soldier #6	Here.
Villager	Hey.
Child villager	Grammy!

One of the soldiers finds Aang in the igloo with some children. Upon noticing his tattoos, he is brought to Zuko. Zuko is astonished to find the tattoos that he seemingly recognized its significance.

Aang	You're scaring these people.
Zuko	Who are you? What's your name!?
Aang	I don't need to tell you anything.
Zuko	Firebenders! [Zuko's soldiers move into positions.] I'm taking you to my ship. If you don't come, I'll burn down this village.
Aang	I'll go with you. Don't hurt anyone.

Aang follows Zuko and his men to the ship. The villagers move closer when a firebender sends out flame over their heads. Sokka and the villagers duck. They helplessly watch Aang being taken away. Cut to the igloo.

Sokka	They were looking for someone old and they were looking for someone with the same markings the boy had.
Katara	They dragged Mom away the same way when we were babies. She wouldn't have watched us being taken away. She would have fought. We found that boy. He's our responsibility. We should fight. What would you do if they tried to take me away?
Sokka	I'd kill them all.
Katara	Why?
Sokka	Because you're my sister. Because Dad told me to protect you with my life.
Katara	Because I'm your responsibility. And this boy is our responsibility.
Sokka	What do you want us to do, Katara? How are we supposed to save him? They're on a ship. We'd need a miracle to catch them. I know you think everything's going to work out, but I don't.

Appa wails louder and louder. When Sokka and Katara hear the sound of laughing children, they immediately go outside to see what is going on. The bison creature floats in the air as if wanting to follow his master, but is held back out of concern of the children hanging dangerously off his feet.

Katara	His bison creature thing floats.

Zuko's ship moves across the icy waters. Aang is kept in a room. The door opens, and Iroh and Zuko walk in. Iroh is amazed to see a young surviving airbender.

Aang	What do you want with me?
Iroh	My nephew wants me to perform a little test on you.
Aang	What kind of test?
Iroh	I assure you, it won't hurt. I've performed it hundreds of times. It only takes a few moments. And then you're free to go. Would you mind if I put a few things in front of you at the table? It will only take a moment.
Aang	That's all you want?
Iroh	My name is Iroh, and you have my word.

Cut to Sokka and Katara in the igloo with Katara's grandmother, Kanna.

Katara	Grandma, I know you're gonna try to stop us, but this is just something I need ...
Kanna	Sit down. [They sit.] I knew from the first time we discovered you were a bender, that one day, I would realize your destiny. There hasn't been a waterbender in the Southern Water Tribe since my friend Hama was taken away. Today, I found out that destiny. Did you see that boy's tattoos?

Sokka and Katara nod.

Kanna	Tattoos like that haven't been seen in over a century. I believe they are airbending tattoos.
Katara	How can that be?
Kanna	I believe that little boy might be the Avatar. [Pulls out a map of the world.] Once, a long time ago, the Spirit World kept balance over us.
Katara	What is the Spirit World, Grandma?
Kanna	It's not a place made up of things you can touch. But it exists, nonetheless. It is filled with the most amazing forms of dazzling creatures ... that exist in the most exotic valleys, mountains and forests. Each of these creatures is a Spirit. They've watched over us since the beginning. They have guided us. And only the Avatar can go speak to them.
Katara	Aren't there Spirits here?
Kanna	Yes, there are some Spirits that live hidden among us, sure they're watching us with great sadness ... the Fire Nation doesn't wish to live by the Spirits. That's why they're so frightened by the existence of the Avatar.
Katara	What can he do?
Kanna	With his mastery of the four elements, he will begin to change hearts. And it is in the heart that all wars are won. Now, go help this boy. He will need you two. And we all need him.

Zuko's uncle, Iroh, conducted a few test on Aang, after assuring him the test would be painless and once complete, he would be free to go. The test involved a candle flame that seemed to be drawn toward to him, a poured water that formed a circle on the table and a smooth rock that stood on an unstable position.

Zuko	You are my prisoner ... airbender. I'm taking you back to the Fire Nation.
Aang	You said ...
Iroh	I apologize. I should have explained further. If you failed the test, as all others did, you were free to leave. But, as it turns out, you are the only one in the entire world who could pass this test. It is truly an honor to be in your presence.
Zuko	Don't even try to escape. This is a warship ...!
Aang leaps over the table and over Zuko and Iroh, then lands behind them. He propels himself backward with airbending through an open door.
Zuko	Stop! There's no way you can ...
Aang uses airbending to close the door, trapping Zuko and Iroh inside as it can only be opened from the outside. The three guards outside se Aang then approach slowly to capture him. Aang pins them against the well with airbending, then goes to the upper deck, grabbing his staff along the way. Out in the open sea, he looks around, then sees Appa landing at a distant icy cliff
Zuko manages to get out of the holding room and came to the upper deck with his men. Aang spun around and turned his staff into a glider.

Zuko	Don't move! You have nowhere to run!

Aang then races across the deck to the bow of the ship, chased by Zuko and his men.

Zuko's soldier #7	Halt!
Zuko's soldier #8	Don't let him escape!
Zuko's soldier #9	Get him!

Aang jumps off the bow. Instead of a splash in the ocean, he appears gliding up to the cliff as Zuko and his men watch in amazement. Aang reunites with his bison creature, with Katara and Sokka.

Aang	Thanks for bringing Appa to me. The Fire Nation is up to something. I have to go back now.
Sokka	We'll come with you.
Aang	I can take you back to the village.
Katara	We're going with you.

Appa flies off the cliff, out of range as Zuko watches in despair.

Iroh	You found the Avatar.
Zuko	For a moment, I had my honor back.
Iroh	Your destinies are tied, Zuko. That, you can be sure of.



Act II (a), The Avatar Returns

Katara	[Narrating.] Aang flew us to his home. He told us how he left there in a storm on Appa, and got forced into the ocean where they almost drowned. Aang airbent a sphere around them, and ice formed. And he couldn't remember anything after that.

Aang, Sokka, and Katara arrive at the Southern Air Temple on the high mountains.

Aang	Hey, Chinto! Monae! I'm back! Hey, guys! I want you to meet someone!
Katara	This is where you live?
Aang	They must be playing some trick or something. Monk Gyatso is gonna try and jump out and scare me at any moment. He's the teacher responsible for me. [Jumps down.] He's kind of like my father.
Katara	Is it okay if you tell me your name?
Aang	The monks named me Aang. [Leads them into the Temple area.] Okay, guys! Enough!

A flying lemur flies toward Aang.

Sokka	Spider rat! They're poisonous! Get behind me.
Aang	He's a flying lemur-bat. We keep them as pets.
Katara	Weren't they extinct a long time ago?
Aang	Extinct? No, there must be thousands of them on this mountain.
Katara	Your friends were monks?
Aang	I know where they are right now. They're at the prayer field.

Aang races across the player field, goes down a flight of steps.

Katara	Aang, wait! I have to talk to you!

Aang is shocked to see human remains and an unkempt field.

Katara	Aang ... I think you were in that ice for almost a hundred years. The firebenders started a war.
Aang	I left a few days ago.
Katara	Aang, the Fire Nation knew the Avatar would be born into the Air Nomads ... so they exterminated all the Air Nomads.
Aang	[Words echoing through the entire area.] You're lying! [Finds a necklace on one of the remains.] This is Monk Gyatso's. I made it for him.

Aang has flashbacks to when he first gave the necklace to Gyatso.

Aang	Nooooooooo ...!

In his rage, his eyes and tattoos glow pure white and strong winds begins to circle around him, lifting him up.

Sokka	Katara! Stay away from him!

Aang is in trance and enters the Spirit World.

Sokka	[Echo.] Katara! Stay away from him!
Katara	[Echo.] Your friends were monks?

Aang walks into a cave. While looking around inside, a head of a dragon pops out from the mist.

Dragon Spirit	The Avatar? Where have you been?
Katara	[Echo.] Aang! You can't bring Monk Gyatso back, but Sokka and I can be with you as long as you need! Don't give up! We can do this together! Aang.

Aang leaves his trance and exited Spirit World. Aang opened his eyes. Katara was behind him.
Zhao spots Zuko on his ship out in the sea.

Zhao	The banished prince. Let's offer him lunch.

Cut scene to the mess hall on the Zhao's ship. Zuko and Iroh sat with Zhao on the main table, in front of Zhao's men in the hall

Zhao	I wanted to thank the great General Iroh and young Prince Zuko for dining with us. As you know, the Fire Lord has banished his son, the prince, and renounced his love of him, and will not let him return to the throne unless he finds the Avatar. The Fire Lord believes his son is too soft, and by doing this, he will become strong and become a worthy heir to the throne.
Zuko subconsciously bends a flame from a candle on the table. Iroh notices this, then holds his hand to calm him down.
Zhao	I commend the Fire Lord's discipline. For example, it seems I need to remind Prince Zuko that, during his banishment, he is an enemy of the Fire Nation and is not allowed to wear the Fire Nation uniform. But we will let him wear it today, like a child wearing a costume.
Zuko	[Stands up and whispers to Zhao.] One day, my father will take me back and you will bow before me.

Zuko storms off the mess hall. Iroh stands up and follows him. Back on his ship, Zuko gazes at his family picture (his mother, his father, his sister and himself) before has begins his training of firebending and hand-to-hand combat with four firebenders. Iroh observes from the deck above, while drinking his tea.
Appa lands in a forest in the Southern Earth Kingdom, where Katara, Sokka and Aang set up camp. Momo, the winged lemur, has become. Aang sits alone making sense of what he saw at the temple and the Spirit World.

Katara	You okay?
Aang	I'll be fine.
Katara	You know, my grandma thinks because you're an airbender, that you could be the Avatar.
Aang	How much does the Fire Nation control?
Katara	A lot of villages in the Earth Kingdom, like around here. They haven't been able to conquer big cities, like Ba Sing Se, but they're making plans, I'm sure.
Sokka	So ... are you the Avatar, Aang?

A young boy bursts out of the woods and seeks refuge with the trio from the Fire Nation soldiers chasing him.

Sokka	What is this?
Katara	Stay hidden.
Lead Fire Nation soldier	That child is being arrested.
Katara	For what?
Lead Fire Nation soldier	He was bending tiny stones at us from behind a tree. It really hurt.
Katara	He can bend earth?
Lead Fire Nation soldier	Earthbending is forbidden in this village.
Katara	Leave him alone. You're not taking him anywhere.
Sokka	No one ... is taking anybody away!
Katara pops open her water pouch and bends the water at the soldiers.
Lead Fire Nation soldier	She's a bender!

The water traps Sokka's arms and chest in ice instead, much to his frustration.

Sokka	Katara!

The soldiers arrest Sokka, Katara, Aang and the young earthbending boy. As they are taken to the prison camp just outside a village, Aang notices the poor condition of the village and its people. They are shoved through a gateway of a tall metal fence.

Fire Nation Prison guard	Move. You, too.

In the prison yard, there are men on the ground, weary and defeated. The earthbending boy has reunited with his father.

Earthbending boy	Dad!
Earthbending boy	This is my father.
Earthbending father	Hello.
Sokka	That's the Fire Nation's plan, suppress all other bending.
Aang	How did this happen to your village?
Earthbending father	Fire Nation sent soldiers. We fought them and defeated them. Then they sent their machines, huge machines made of metal. There was nothing we could do. Those who could not bend were allowed to live in peace, if we were imprisoned.
Aang	Earthbenders! Why are you acting this way? You are powerful and amazing people! You don't need to live like this! There is earth right beneath your feet. The ground ... is an extension of who you are!

The earthbenders are dismissive and non-responsive

Aang	If the Avatar had returned ... would that mean anything to you?
Earth Kingdom prisoner	The Avatar is dead. If he was here, he would protect us.
Aang	My name is Aang ... and I am the Avatar. [Unhoods himself to reveal his airbending tattoos.] I ran away, but I'm back now. It's time for you to stop doing this!
Fire Nation prison guard	The Avatar would have to be an airbender. Are you an airbender, boy?

Katara angrily pushes the soldier away.

Katara	Leave him alone!

The prison guard was furious, then tries to grab Katara, but Aang uses airbending to push him away

Fire Nation head prison guard	How is he doing that?
Aang	I don't want to hurt anyone.
Fire Nation head prison guard	All airbenders should be dead. Kill him! Firebenders, positions!
Sokka	Okay! Everybody can help us now!

The earthbending boy throws a pebble behind the lead soldier; he turns and bends a flame from the nearby fire pit at the boy. The father raises an earth barrier to protect his son. The other earthbenders watch the event unfold and rise with renewed sense of hope.

Katara	Don't be afraid!

Seeking to restore order, the lead soldier with another firebender launches a large flame toward the father and the boy, but it is blocked by a larger barrier, which six earthbenders raise in unison. Another earthbender raises a rock and accelerates it at the other soldier, and earth-blocks a flame attack from the lead soldier. Sokka takes down the lead soldier while Aang takes out another. After a few more airbending moves from Aang and a boomerang attack thrown by Sokka, the remaining soldiers retreat. Outside the prison, Aang takes out a few more soldiers in the village. After everything is settled, the villagers break open a shed holding all tools related to bending.

Old man of Kyoshi Town	They took away any tools related to bending.

Momo goes in the shed and knocks over a waterbending scroll. A villager picks up the scroll and gave it to Katara.

Kyoshi villager	The Fire Nation took this scroll from a member of your Water Tribe.
Katara	A waterbending scroll. This is rare. My mom told me about these.
Aang is taken to the statue of Avatar Kyoshi
Old man of Kyoshi Town	This was you when you were born an earthbender, two lifetimes ago. You came to our village. Avatar Kyoshi loved games.
Aang	I do, too. I mean, I still do.
Aang later met with Sokka and Katara.
Sokka	A lot of the villages in this part of the Earth Kingdom are occupied by the Fire Nation, like this village was. They prey on the weakest towns and villages. We should go visit some of these towns, Aang.
Aang	I need to tell you something.
Katara	What is it, Aang?
Aang	I ran away before they trained me to be the Avatar. I don't know how to bend the other elements.
Katara	Why did you run away?
Aang	The day they told me I was the Avatar, they said I could never have a normal life, that I could never have a family. They said it cannot work with the responsibilities of the Avatar.
Katara	Why can't the Avatar have a family?
Aang	I asked that! They said that's the sacrifice the Avatar always has to make.
Sokka	Okay. So, what if we found you teachers. Teachers to teach you bending? Which element would you have to learn first?
Aang	Water. Water comes after air in the cycle. Air, water, earth, fire.
Sokka	But there are really powerful benders in the Northern Water Tribe. My dad told me about it before he left. It's led by a princess because her father died. There are teachers there, but all the way on the other side of the world.
Aang	We can get there on Appa.
Sokka	That's what I was thinking. And maybe we can stop in the villages on the way, start a change in The War in these small villages. Should we try it?
Aang	Yes, we should.

The team of Aang, Sokka, Katara, Momo and Appa, set out on the journey to the north. Along the way they visit the villages, where Aang announces the Avatar had returned. In villages that were still occupied by Fire Nation soldiers, Aang uses his airbending to defeat them and liberate the village from their grip.
Meanwhile, Zuko and two soldiers, disguised as travelers of the Earth Kingdom, visit the first village Aang liberated. They also enter the former prison camp and look around.



Act II (b), The Blue Spirit

Katara	[Narrating.] The scroll we had was proving to be helpful. Aang was practicing, but for some reason, he was having trouble with waterbending. We moved from town to town in the Earth Kingdom. We tried to stay out of sight, but Sokka became concerned we were being followed.

On Zhao's flagship, a soldier enters the war room and whispers some information to Zhao. Later, at the Fire Nation palace, Zhao meets with Ozai.

Zhao	Sire, I have good news. As you know, I conducted a raid on the Great Library, which most said didn't exist.
Ozai	Get on with it.
Zhao	I found scrolls in the library. We are deciphering them. But I believe they may contain information as to where the Ocean and Moon Spirits live in this world. With this information, we could bring down the Northern Water Tribe city, we could show the world the true strength of fire.
Ozai	I am pleased. Well, Commander Zhao, are the rumors true or not?
Zhao	Our spies have discovered someone claiming to be the Avatar. They describe him as just a boy. We should set a trap for this person. We have many Earth Kingdom people under our control. I can leave soldiers hidden in certain locations.
Ozai	And my son?
Zhao	He had his chance. He missed it.
Ozai	Let's hope, for your sake, my son doesn't find this person first and he turns out to be the Avatar. He would return as a hero and, for all purposes, be your superior.
Zhao	Well, I suppose it's a race, then.

At the Fire Nation Colony Fifteen located in the Northern Earth Kingdom, Zuko sat with his uncle Iroh sat in a tea shop, with his face hidden by the hood of his cloak to avoid being recognized.

Zuko	We're close, Uncle. They've been moving farther and farther north. We're catching them.
Iroh	There are a lot of pretty girls in this town, Zuko. You could fall in love here. We could settle down here, and you could have a blessed life. We don't have to continue this, Zuko.
Zuko	I'll show you why we must, Uncle. Hey. Hey. Little one, come here.
Zuko	You look like a very smart boy. Tell me what you know about the prince, the Fire Lord's son.
Teahouse Child	He did something wrong.
Zuko	He spoke out of turn to a general, in defense of some of his friends who were going to be sacrificed in a battle.
Teahouse Child	Then Prince Zuko was sentenced to an Agni Ki duel, but when he showed up, it was his father he was to fight.
Zuko	That's right.
Teahouse Child	He would not fight his father.
Zuko	Then his father mocked him and said, "I should bring your sister up here to beat you."
Teahouse child	Then the father burnt his son ... to teach him a lesson. [Leaves.]
Zuko	[Turning to his uncle.] We'll catch him soon, Uncle. Then we can think about the pretty girls.
At the shore of a sparking lake beside a forest, Katara and Aang practiced waterbending while Sokka tended to a campfire nearby.
Katara	Aang ... try to keep your wrist bent, like it's showing.
Katara	What's wrong? You've really been distracted today.
Aang	I saw Sokka's maps. We're near the Northern Air Temple. Do you think it would be okay if I just visited there and came back? I'd be back in less than a day.

Later, Katara filled in Sokka in on what Aang wanted to do.

Sokka	Why?
Katara	He had a vision at the Southern Air Temple prayer field. He talked to a Dragon Spirit who he thinks can help us. He thinks if he goes to another spiritual place, he can get back to the Spirit World.
Sokka	I don't think that's a good idea. We started a rebellion. Try to talk him out of it.

Aang continued practicing waterbending in the dark, while Sokka and Katara were sleeping. He managed to raise the three short pillars of water. As he closes his eyes concentrating, ripples and waves began to form on the lake. He remembers Gyatso giving lessons to him and the other students in the open field and then images of skeletal remains he saw earlier. When he opened his eyes, he was surprised to see the result of his lack of control over waterbending.

Aang	I can't do this. I need help.

Convinced that Aang needed help immediately from the Dragon Spirit, he woke up Appa to head over to the Northern Air Temple. Sokka and Katara woke up and saw him took off. She assured Sokka that Aang will back in a day, but Sokka was concerned the Fire Nation might catch him.

Sokka	I guess your talk didn't work.
Katara	He'll be back in a day.
Sokka	The Fire Nation is following us. If we make a wrong move, they'll catch him.

Appa lands at the Northern Air Temple. As Aang makes his way in the temple ruins, he finds an old man.

Old man in temple	Who are you? Why, it cannot be! I've heard stories. Are you?
Aang	My name is Aang.
Old man in temple	I cannot believe I've lived to see your return. I'm an earth villager, but I visit these temple remains often.
Aang	The Fire Nation destroyed this temple. They have ruined everything.
Old man in temple	No, no, no, not everything. You know, there's a hidden chamber of statues I think you, of all people, should see. [Leads Aang to a hidden chamber of statues of past Avatars.] These are all the Avatars. These are the reincarnations of you over the years. The Avatar Roku was your last life. Now, how did the airbenders know you were the Avatar, little one?
Aang	They gave me a test. They put 1,000 toys in front of me and asked me to choose four. They said I chose the same four objects that belonged to the previous Avatars. That's when they told me I could have no family. Told me I had a responsibility to the Four Nations. There's a ceremony when everyone bows to me. That's when I accept my role as the Avatar. But when everyone bowed ... I didn't bow back.
Old man in temple	You seem like a nice young man. You really do. You will forgive me, won't you?
Aang	For what?
Old man in temple	For luring you down here.

Confused, Aang turns to see him surrounded by Fire Nation archers hiding behind the statues.

Old man in temple	I have lived in poverty because of your absence, Avatar. So you will understand my actions today.
O
ther Fire Nation soldiers poured into the chamber – one of them passed the old man a pouch of money as a reward. Unable to escape, Aang resigned himself to surrender.
Aang is later hung from chains in a prayer room in the Northern Air Temple. Aang closes his eyes and entered the Spirit World.

Old man in temple	[Echo.] I have lived in poverty because of your absence, Avatar.

Aang finds his way back to cave and meets the Dragon Spirit again.

Dragon Spirit	I have seen a vision of the moon turning red. The Fire Nation has stolen knowledge of us from the Great Library. They are planning to misuse this knowledge.
Aang	I will stop them.
Dragon Spirit	You must go to the Northern Water Tribe. If they take that city, more will suffer and die, as your airbenders have. You must go now
Aang	Will I stop them?

Aang is forcibly pulled from the Spirit World, being woken up by Zhao.

Zhao	Wake up, young man. My name is Commander Zhao. I set this trap for you. Don't worry, I'm not gonna kill you. Besides, you'd just be reborn again, and then the search would continue. So where have you been all this time? And how is it that you're still a boy? I understand that when you freed that handful of towns, you were very impressive, but ... you only used airbending against my soldiers. Now, why is that?

Later, a Fire Nation tank rolls on the bridge that connects to the temple. A blue-masked figure hitches a ride by grabbing onto its undercarriage. Zhao addresses his assembly of soldiers in the courtyard.

Zhao	The Fire Lord and I have a plan to ensure our reign and the downfall of our enemies. I am sending a personal message to the Fire Lord, informing him that the once feared Avatar is our prisoner and no threat to our might.

The figure heads toward the prayer room, stealthily taking down the soldiers posted along the way there. He enters the prayer room.

Aang	Who are you?

The figure pulls his dual swords about the strike.

Aang	Wait! Don't ...!

The figure severs the chains. Aang falls down on the floor and holds up his chained hands.

Aang	Stop!

The figure cuts the cuffs off Aang's hand. He gives Aang's staff back then motions Aang to follow him. Zhao and his assistant head toward the prayer room when he discovers the downed soldiers.

Zhao	Fools.

His assistant quickly runs back upstairs to alert the other soldiers.

Zhao's assistant	Close the inner gates! The Avatar has escaped!

Aang uses airbending to knock two soldiers block his path. He enters the temple courtyard with the blue-masked figure, referred by the soldiers as the Blue Spirit. They are surrounded by many Fire Nation soldiers.

Fire Nation soldier #1	Lock down the gate!
Fire Nation soldier #2	Lock down all the gates!

A fire attack from behind forces them to evade and split up, fighting the soldiers on the opposite sides on the courtyard. Aang ends up in the practice area.

Fire Nation soldier	To the main post!
Aang	This was their practice area.
Fire Nation Soldier	Go again!

Aang uses the airbending practice area to take out the soldiers, then leaps out of the courtyard and ran on the stepping pillars that the soldiers are unable to follow. Aang prepares to fly out using his staff-glider but seeing the Blue Spirit still fending off the soldiers by himself, Aang flies back to fight alongside him.

Zhao	Do not kill the Avatar! He will just be reborn again!

The Blue Spirit quickly grabs Aang and threateningly holds his sword at Aang's throat.

Zhao	Why are you doing this? Who are you?

Zhao notices a human mouth behind the blue mask.

Zhao	Open the gates. Let them out.

The soldiers remained at the courtyard while the Blue Spirit led Aang across the bridge. Zhao head up on a high balcony.

Lead Archer	Is it some kind of Spirit, Commander?
Zhao	Not at all. [Turns his head to the Lead Archer.] Do it.

At the end of the bridge, Zhao's archer shoots down the Blue Spirit with single arrow. The soldiers rush across the bridge to capture them. Aang discovers the unconscious Blue Spirit was Zuko. He uses airbending to pull in the fog and mask their getaway.

Zhao	What is this?

Once the fog clears, Aang and the Blue Spirit are nowhere to be found.
Aang takes care of Zuko till the next morning, then left Zuko still unconscious by the camp-fire in the forest, leaping from tree to tree.

A few days later, Zhao arrives at the Fire Nation palace, being summoned into the throne room.

Ozai	And how did he escape?
Zhao	I fear that your son is not only incompetent, but also a traitor. Of course, I cannot prove this, sire.
Ozai	You think ... my son is this person the soldiers are calling the Blue Spirit.
Zhao	Yes.

Back in the Northern Earth Kingdom, Iroh relaxes and receives a foot message from an earth villager woman when Zuko walks past him.

Iroh	Zhao's men were searching the coast, looking for you. They also searched the ship. I told them you went on vacation with a girl. Where were you for the past four days?
Zuko	Nowhere. We have to keep moving. The Avatar is traveling again.
Iroh	Take rest first. It looks like you went through a great deal. When you wake, we'll have tea together before we start the engines.
Ozai	[Voice-over.] Do not harm my son. Leave him to his isolation.
Zhao	[Voice-over.] You have my word, sire. I will not harm him.

As Zuko lay down on his bed in his ship, he notices something hissing near the torch on his wall. Zuko dashes out just before the ship explodes into a huge, orange fireball. Iroh moves in to protect the woman from the blast as he cries out to Zuko.

Iroh	Zuko!

Cut to Appa (carrying Aang and the others) swimming toward the Northern Water Tribe.

Ozai	[Voice-over.] And what of the Avatar?

Cut back to Ozai's throne room.

Zhao	We assume he has rejoined with his supporters. It has been confirmed that he's traveling north. It is my strong belief that he is traveling to the Northern Water Tribe.

Aang and the others find waterbenders practicing in the open water. Sokka waves at them. They are led to the city of the Northern Water Tribe.

Zhao	[Voice-over.] I believe the child Avatar has only knowledge of his birth element, air. I believe he is trying to learn in the discipline of water. He's gone to seek out someone in the Northern Water Tribe, where they have lived beyond our reach and openly practice waterbending.

Aang and the others are led into the city, the entranced seals shut behind them with waterbending.



Act III, The Siege of the North

Katara	[Narrating.] We arrived at the Northern Water Tribe. We presented ourselves to the royal court. My brother and the princess became friends right away. Aang showed them he was the last airbender, and was accepted to train with the master. The city knew our arrival would bring great danger. And they prepared for war they knew would come in the ensuing weeks.

Pakku lays out their defense strategy to Yue, with Sokka by her side.

Pakku	The city was designed to withstand any assault. If we keep them to the courtyard and the marketplace till night falls, where we have the advantage, we will succeed. If we let too many of them into the city, their sheer numbers could overwhelm us. As many fires in this city should be put out as possible when the alarm sounds. We want to minimize their bender sources. I must assign a guard to be with you at all times, Princess. Your presence is our inspiration.
Sokka	I'll do it. That's me. I'll be her guard. Nothing will happen to her.
Pakku	I had a feeling you might volunteer.

At the Fire Nation palace.

Ozai	I've heard no word of my son for quite some time. Do you know where he is?
Zhao	I've not heard of anything, sire. I'm sure word of him will come to us soon.
Ozai	The Northern Water Tribe benders are given their strength by the Moon and Ocean Spirits. They will be difficult to defeat. Now, if for some reason the Spirits were not involved, that would be different. What have you learned from the stolen scrolls?
Zhao	We have deciphered the location of the Moon and Ocean Spirits.
Ozai	It is our destiny ... to have found this information, Zhao. Eliminate the Spirits. Take the city and we will have thwarted the Avatar in the process.

The Fire Nation fleet is later seen leaving the ports, heading out to the city.
Katara and Aang has attend a waterbending class taught by Pakku.

Pakku	Water is what?
Students	The flowing element. The element of change.
Pakku	To master water, you must release your emotions, wherever they may lead you. Water teaches us acceptance. Let your emotions flow like water. [To Aang.] Aang, would you like to spar? You haven't sparred in a few days.

Pakku encases Aang in an icy prison; Aang gracefully waterbends the ice away. Pakku sends him three water balls, which Aang successful catches in mid-air and disperses.

Pakku	Now, use offense, Aang

Aang attempts an offensive move as instructed, but he only manages to raise droplets of water and inadvertently raises the waters in the nearby canals. Aang stops, realizing his still lack control over his incredible waterbending ability, as Pakku and the students watch in astonishment.
On the Fire Nation flagship that leads the rest of fleet, Iroh meets with Zhao on the upper deck.

Zhao	General Iroh, I'm glad you could accept my invitation to join us on this historic event.
Iroh	Your invitation was most gracious.
Zhao	You are a gifted strategist. No one can argue that. Your failure in the Hundred Day Siege of Ba Sing Se won't be held against you. Your son died in that siege, didn't he?
Iroh	Yes, he did.
Zhao	Again, I offer my condolences on your nephew burning to death in that terrible accident.
Iroh	Thank you.

Sokka and Yue spend some time enjoy each other's company.

Yue	I've loved spending these weeks with you, Sokka.
Sokka	Me, too.
Yue	Should we see what the ocean is doing today?

They head over to the fort walls for the ocean view.

Yue	When there is some safety for all of us, I will come visit our sister city in the Southern Water Tribe and spend some time in your home.
Sokka	That would be great. But I warn you ... my grandmother will ask you a lot of questions.
Yue	What might she ask me?
Sokka	She'll say, "Why is your hair white, young lady? You look very odd."
Yue	I would say to your grandmother, my hair is white because when I was born, I was not awake. My mother and father could not get me to make a sound or move. So they prayed for days to the Moon Spirit and dipped me into the sacred waters. My parents said that my hair turned white then and life poured into me.
Sokka	Wow. You didn't tell me that.
Yue	You didn't ask me. Only your grandmother did.

Iroh went below deck and met with Zuko, who was still alive.

Iroh	I'm sure Zhao was the one who ordered the attack on you.
Zuko	Any problems?
Iroh	We have arrived at the Northern Water Tribe's stronghold. They believe the boy is there.
Zuko	Why do you seem upset, Uncle?
Iroh	Zhao has no sacredness. Are you sure you want to be here?
Zuko	I will not be allowed to live in peace until I bring the Avatar to my father! Is that not clear to you?

Aang and Katara practice their waterbending forms when the black ashes fall all over the city.

Yue	[Confused.] What is this?
Sokka	Yue ... the Fire Nation is here.

The ashes came from the burning engines of the Fire Nation ships. At the rear of Zhao's flagship, Zuko wearing a white camouflage suit stepped into a small boat.

Iroh	Now be sure to keep your uniform closed up to your neck. And remember, your Chi can warm you.
Zuko	I know, Uncle.
Iroh	Be safe.

Zuko heads out near the shore of the stronghold, then dive in. He finds a spot underneath the city with thin layer of ice, then generates heat from his chi to melt the spot and breaks through the surface, into an unoccupied room.
Sokka takes Aang into the balcony room, to see Yue, who oversees the Fire Nation armada with Katara.

Katara	Aang needs to ask you something.
Aang	I have to talk to the Dragon Spirit. He can help me defeat the Fire Nation. Is there a spiritual place where I can meditate?
Yue	There is a very spiritual place. The city was built around this place. But we must hurry.

Yue leads Aang, Katara, and Sokka to the place. Zuko notices them from the rooftops, and follows them to an entrance into the side of a icy hill. Inside, they step into a spiritual cave with an oasis pond. In the middle of the pond is a tree with a ground path leading to it. Momo reaches into the pond to touch one of the two fish, one black and the other white.

Aang	Momo, be nice.

Momo scampers and flies away.

Aang	To get your airbending tattoos, you have to meditate for long periods of time without losing focus. Some of the great monks can meditate for four days.

As Aang sits down to meditate near the tree, two fish swirl together in a circle and glow in their insides.

Yue	I have to get back.
Sokka	I'll take you.
Katara	I'll stay with him.

Sokka escorts Yue back while Katara stays with Aang as he meditates into a trance.

Katara	Aang? Aang, can you hear me? I knew you were real. I always knew you'd return.
Zuko	Me, too.
Katara	The Fire Lord's son. You took him from our village.

Zuko sets his torch down to set the grass on fire, as Katara takes a defensive stance. Zuko sends out a fire blast, which she takes out with two large stream with water from the pond. With the second blast, Katara takes it out with a single stream. Zuko is surprised and impressed of her waterbending ability.

Zuko	Who are you?
Katara	My name is Katara, and I'm the only waterbender left in the Southern Water Tribe.

Zuko then firebends a curved blast and a straight blast. Overwhelmed with the complexity of Zuko's attack, she deflects the curved blast but is knocked hard against the tree with the other blast.
As the large city bell was rung, the Northern Water Tribe residents hurriedly seek for shelter all over the city. Soldiers were seen lining up on the fort walls, overlooking the large Fire Nation fleet nearing its attack range. As Pakku gives out the battle cry, the soldiers rattled the end of their spears against the icy floor for morale.

Water Tribe civilian #1	Go for the children.
Water Tribe civilian #2	Yes.

Zuko rests Katara's unconscious body next to the tree and checks her condition.

Zuko	I'm not allowed to go home without him.

Northern Water Tribe soldiers and waterbenders are seen lining up on the fort walls, overlooking the large Fire Nation fleet nearing its attack range. As Pakku gives out the battle cry, the soldiers rattle the end of their spears against the icy floor for morale.
Iroh enters the war room on Zhao's ship.

Iroh	The waterbenders get power from the moon. They will get stronger as the day comes to an end.
Zhao	General Iroh, I've been keeping a secret.
Iroh	And what is that?
Zhao	In my raid of the Great Library earlier this year, I found a scroll that tells the location of the Ocean and Moon Spirits.
Iroh	To meet a Spirit would be a great honor.
Zhao	Well, I hope I can give you that honor.

The Fire Nation invasion of the Northern Water Tribe stronghold was fully underway. A firebender riding Komodo-Rhino stepped off the ship's platform and scaled up the icy fort walls. At the top, the firebender uses the fiery metal spheres catapulted from the ship to blast the city below. Spinning drills break through the surface at many locations within the city, where soldiers emerge from the sea below.
Sokka came back to the spiritual place with Yue, and found Katara lying unconscious near the tree. He woke her up.

Sokka	What happened?
Katara	Prince Zuko's here in the city. He took Aang again.

Elsewhere, Zuko places Aang down in a storage room in the stronghold, still in trance with his hands bound with rope. Zuko peers out the window, looking down the battle taking place below.

Zuko	We'll just wait till everyone's fighting everyone. Then in the night, we'll slip out.

Back to the point when Aang entered the Spirit World

Katara	[Voice-over.] Aang, can you hear me? I knew you were real. I always knew you'd return.

Aang sees the lanterns which leads him back to the cave again.

Aang	Hello! Hello! [Enters the cave and finds the Dragon Spirit inside.] Please, tell me how to beat the Fire Nation!
Dragon Spirit	You are not dealing with the loss of your people, and your responsibility for their deaths. You are stopping yourself from grieving. You are angry. You must let this go. As the Avatar, you are not meant to hurt others. [Slithers past Aang and out of the cave, but then peers back at Aang.] Use the ocean. Show them the power of water. Go! Do this now.

The Dragon spreads its mighty wings and lifts itself into the sky, as Aang leaves his trance.

Zuko	[Voice-over.] My sister Azula was always the special one. She was a firebending prodigy.

Aang finds himself hand bound in the storage room, and overhears Zuko talking while he is still looking out the window.

Zuko	My father loves her. He can't even look at me sometimes. He says I'm like my mother.

Aang takes off, leaping over barrels, with Zuko chasing right behind him. He firebends the flames from the torches to take Aang down, in the process blasting away items in the room.
Just outside the stronghold, a firebender concentrates a large flame through a nozzle on a ship to breach the fort wall. He succeeds in creating a hole, which is large enough for Fire Nation soldiers and Komodo rhino-riders to freely enter the city. Master Pakku waterbends the soldiers in the courtyard. Cut back to the flagship.

Iroh	I advise that you pull back your men soon. They will be trapped in the city when the moon's power comes out.
Zhao	Do not worry about the moon's power, General Iroh.
Iroh	Why should you not be worried about the moon's power?
Zhao	Because your brother, Fire Lord Ozai, and I have decided it is in our best interests to kill the Moon Spirit.
Iroh	What?

Zuko searches for Aang hiding in the storage room. His hands now free, Aang uses airbending to distract Zuko and tried to escape. The situation escalates to a fight, later with firebending and airbending.
Katara follows Sokka and Yue back into the city, with the battle ongoing.

Katara	Calm down. We'll find him.

Katara then sees the flames illuminating from the window of the storage room from the city below.
As the fight between Aang and Zuko turns into a standoff, they notice that room is rumbling. The water in the barrels begin to shake, then spirals to Zuko encasing him in ice. Aang turns to see Katara, who completes her waterbending move.

Katara	Are you okay? Did the Spirits tell you anything?
Aang	Yes. The Dragon Spirit talked to me. I know what to do.
Katara	Aang, we have to go.

Katara then left the room with Sokka and Yue. Aang peered out the window was astonished at the battle in the city. Before leaving the room, he melted the ice around Zuko's head so Zuko can breathe.

Aang	You won't be killed by waterbenders if you stay hidden here. [Walking to the doorway, he turns toward Zuko.] We could be friends, you know.

Zhao and Iroh enter the Water Tribe stronghold through the breach, flanked by Fire Nation soldiers. He uses the scroll from the Great Library to lead his men and Iroh to where they need to go.

Zhao	They're getting stronger. This is a scroll from the Great Library. This is our map. Our world is going to change soon, gentlemen.

Some soldiers approach the civilians.

Fire Nation soldier	Right there and right there.

The soldiers step back, seeing Appa growling at them.

Elsewhere, Aang heads toward the courtyard with Sokka, Yue and Katara, when he notices Zhao heading somewhere with the scroll in his hand.

Aang	See where they're going! I'll go join the fight!

Aang joins the fight in the main courtyard. Meanwhile, back at the storage room, Zuko uses his chi-heat to melt the ice and free himself. Elsewhere, Zhao and Iroh end up at the same spiritual place where Aang meditated.

Zhao	They are called many names: Yin and Yang, "push" and "pull". May I introduce you to the mysterious Ocean and Moon Spirits? [Scoops the white fish into his pouch.] Why do Spirits take the form of such benign things? It leaves them so vulnerable.
Iroh	To teach man kindness and humility.

Zhao prepares to kill the Moon Spirit.

Iroh	Commander Zhao, there are certain things humankind should not tamper with. The Spirits and the Spirit World is one of them.

Just then, Katara, Sokka, and Yue burst into the spiritual place.

Yue	What are you doing here?
Iroh	Stop, Zhao. The world will go out of balance. Everyone will be hurt.
Zhao	The Fire Nation, is, too powerful ... to worry about children's superstitions, General Iroh.
Iroh	Commander Zhao, don't.
Zhao	We are now the gods!

Zhao overcomes his hesitation and stabbed the fish with his dagger.

Iroh	No!

Yue collapses onto the grass, as if she was the one who was struck. Outside, pain shoots through Aang's head. The moon slowly turns red, casting a sickly crimson glow over the Northern city. The waterbenders lose their Moon enhanced powers.

Fire Nation soldier	All men, battle stations!

Cut back to the spiritual place.

Zhao	You are too soft, General Iroh.

In rage, Iroh creates large fires from his hands.

Fire Nation soldier	He's making fire out of nothing!

Zhao, unable to comprehend or combat this great power, turns and flees from the spiritual place, along with his men. Iroh lowers his hands and his flames die down and disappear.
With the Moon power gone, more Fire Nation soldiers pour into city through three breaches now made on the fort walls.

Water Tribe soldier	They're breaching the wall!
Water Tribe soldier	To the front!

Aang looks at the losing battle surrounding him, as the Dragon Spirit's words are heard again.

Dragon Spirit	[Echo.] As the Avatar, you are not meant to hurt others. You must show them the power of water.

At the spiritual place, Yue and the others grieved for the loss of the Moon spirit.

Yue	All is lost.
Iroh	You have been anointed by the Moon Spirit.
Yue	He gave me life when I was a child.
Iroh	Then there is still a chance. You can give your life back for the Spirit's.
Sokka	Don't listen to him, he's Fire Nation.
Iroh	Nothing is ever truly lost.
Yue	Is it mine to give back, if I choose?
Iroh	There are reasons each of us are born. We have to find those reasons.
Yue	This was the reason I was born.
Sokka	Yue, please.
Yue	There is no love without sacrifice.
Sokka	Yue, what are you doing? You don't know what will happen.
Yue	I believe my life force will leave my body and return to the Moon Spirit.
Sokka	And then what?
Yue	My soul will no longer exist in this form.
Sokka	Please don't do this. There must be another way. I can't let you do this. I'm supposed to protect you.
Yue	My people are dying, Sokka. Those who are in charge of others have a responsibility. It is time we show the Fire Nation we believe in our beliefs as much as they believe in theirs.
Sokka	But Yue ...
Yue	I'm scared. Don't make me any more scared. I will miss you more than you know.

She gives Sokka a final kiss and enters the pond. As her life force leaves her to revive the Moon spirit, her white hair turns black. There is a pause in battle when the Moon reverts back to its natural glow. Iroh lifts her lifeless body out of the pond and lays her down on the grass. Distraught, Sokka cries over her lifeless body.
Zhao is on a bridge, seemingly in despair of his failure of killing the Moon, when Zuko steps out from the mist, walking toward him.

Zhao	I killed you.

Zuko prepares to duel Zhao when Iroh appears.

Iroh	Come away from him, nephew. There are too many soldiers now. They will never let you take the Avatar. We must leave immediately. He wants to fight you so he can capture you, Zuko. Walk away. [Zuko stands his ground, staring at Zhao with deadly intensity.] Come!

Zuko turns and walks back toward Iroh. As they walk away, the enraged Zhao bends a large double-spiral fire attack to them. Iroh quickly steps in front of Zuko and redirects the flames to sides, shielding him and Zuko.

Iroh	You stand alone. And that has always been your great mistake.

They leave Zhao standing alone on the bridge. The flames had attracted the attention of four waterbenders, now blocking Zhao's path off the bridge. Outnumbered, Zhao had no way of escaping and no chance of defeating them, especially with the return of the Moon's power. Refusing to surrender, Zhao provoked the waterbenders by bending a fire shot that barely hit any of the waterbenders. He then took off his cloak and waited to be finished off. Four large stream of water bent from the river below engulfed Zhao into a water sphere, drowning him.
Aang races toward the fort wall, using waterbending to trap and stop Fire Nation soldiers along the way. He sends an airbending blast through the courtyard, opening a path through the battle forces, leading him right to the wall. At the top, he looks out at the vast Fire Nation fleet in the ocean.

Pakku	[Voice-over.] Water teaches us acceptance. Let your emotions flow like water.

He recalls images of his life with Gyatso and his friends, and then the fateful event where everyone bowed to him but ran away instead of bowing back. Freeing himself of his guilt, Aang used with the Ocean's power to push a massive body of water up against the fort wall, and Moon's power to pull it toward the sky. His eyes and tattoos glowed bluish-white as he unleashes "the power of water". The battle paused again at the incredible feat of waterbending. The Fire Nation soldiers in the city tried to retreat through a breach but it was blocked by the water. Aang bent the water toward the Fire Nation fleet but kept it hovering threateningly above them. Knowing that the water could easily crush the fleet, the Fire Nation accepted defeat and turned away. Aang bent the water back into the ocean and watched the fleet in retreat.

Katara	Aang?

Katara hugs Aang as he was cheered from the city below. She and Sokka help an exhausted Aang down the stairs into the courtyard. Aang sees the entire Northern Water Tribe waiting for him. They all kneel and bow before him. The remaining Fire Nation soldiers left in the city also bow, in awe of his power and moved by his show of mercy.

Katara	They want you to be their Avatar, Aang. We all do.

Katara and Sokka bow alongside the others. Finally accepting his role as the Avatar, Aang bows back.



Epilogue

The story closes with Ozai's exposition at the Fire Nation place, directed to his daughter Azula, who kneels before him.

Ozai	Our forces in the Northern Water Tribe have failed to take the city. General Zhao was killed in battle and my brother has become a traitor. My son's proven himself a failure. Now, Sozin's Comet is returning in three years. It will give all firebenders the ability of the highest firebenders, the ability to use their own Chi to create fire. That is the day we will win this war and prove the Fire Nation's dominance. Now you must stop the Avatar from mastering earth and fire. You must give us the time to get to that day. Do you accept this unspeakably important task I'm putting in your hands?
Azula	I do, Father.





Prologue

The film begins with metal letters reading 'The Last Airbender'. As they fade away, a silhouetted figure appears, who bends a blob of water from the bottom of the screen. Cut to another figure, who lifts a piece of earth out of the ground and kicks it away. Cut to a third figure, who manipulates a stream of fire with his hands and blasts it at camera. Cut to the final figure, who twirls around and blasts air at the camera.
Cut to a text crawl, which is narrated by Katara.

Katara	[Narrating.] A hundred years ago, all was right with our world. Prosperity and peace filled our days. The Four Nations: water, earth, fire and Air Nomads lived amongst each other in harmony. Great respect was afforded to all those who could bend their natural element. The Avatar was the only person born amongst all the nations who could master all four elements. He was the only one who could communicate with the Spirit World. With the Spirits' guidance, the Avatar kept balance in the world. [Continues with single text on screen.] And then, a hundred years ago, he just disappeared.



Act I, The Boy in the Iceberg

A screen of text appears, reading Book One: Water with the waterbending symbol below. It fades to a scene of water swishing gently back and forth. The camera pans to reveal Katara practicing her forms on the edge of the ice. She eventually levitates a small sphere of water out of the ocean and plays with it gently before accidentally tripping and sending it flying down off-screen. Sokka leaps up from off-screen, soaked from the impact.

Katara	I'm sorry. I'm sorry! Hey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry ...
Katara	I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Hey! It worked better that time.
Katara	I thought about Mom. Isn't that strange?
Sokka	Yeah. I guess so. Just stop doing that stuff around me. I always get wet.
Katara accompanies Sokka on a hunt for food for their tribe.
Katara	[Narrating.] My brother and I live in the Southern Water Tribe, which was once a big city. Our father is off fighting in The War. My mother was taken prisoner and killed when I was young. In this time of war, food is scarce. My brother and I often go hunting for food, but, unfortunately, my brother isn't the best hunter in the world.

Sokka follows the tiger seal tracks, leading them out to the vast open field of ice

Sokka	Tiger seal.
Katara	Are you sure?
Sokka	I did everything Dad said to do. I watched which side of the fin tracks are more indented. That shows which direction they're going. I saw how long the drag skids are. That shows you how fast they're going.
Katara	There's something under there.
Sokka uses his boomerang to crack the floor open but the cracks expand and start a cave-in.
Sokka	It's a cave-in! Move away from the cracks.

A large ice sphere emerges from the cracks with a silhouette of a person inside it.

Sokka	Katara, don't go near it. This is probably some Fire Nation trick. Just back away really slow.

As Sokka turns around, Katara grabs his boomerang and uses it to crack the sphere.

Sokka	Katara! Do not hit that sphere!

The ice sphere breaks part, shooting a bright light high to the sky, which catches the attention of Prince Zuko on a faraway ship

Zuko	Uncle, look!

In the resulting ice crater, Katara and Sokka slide down to discover a thirteen-year-old boy, Aang, alive but exhausted, with his large six-legged bison creature, Appa.

Katara	Is he breathing?
Sokka	Did you see that light shoot into the sky?
Katara	What's your name? How did you get here? How did you get in the ice? [The boy turns toward Katara but is too tired to speak.] He's exhausted. [To Sokka.] We need to get him back to the village.
Sokka	[Pokes around Appa, who is still sleeping.] What is this thing? [Appa's tail accidentally lands on top of Sokka.] It's trying to eat me!

Aang is taken back to the village where he soon recovered in an igloo. Appa follows them home off-screen, much to the amazement of the villagers

Villager	Look. See?

Katara enters the igloo where the boy was recovering. As he puts on his shirt, Katara sees the tattoos on his back

Katara	How'd you get all the way out here?
Aang	I ran away from home. We got in a storm. We were forced under the water of the ocean.
Katara	Oh, I see.
Aang	It wasn't very smart. I was just upset. Thanks for saving me.
Katara	Lucky.
Aang	I probably should get home. They'll all be worried.
Katara	You're not still upset?
Aang	Not as much as I was.

Outside, Zuko's ship smashes through the icy landscape toward the village. Sokka later leads a train of children into the igloo

Sokka	The Fire Nation is here.
Katara	What?
Sokka	And they brought their machines.

Katara was heading out of the igloo with Sokka, then turned to Aang

Sokka	Don't come out till I tell you it's safe.
Aang	Is something wrong?
Katara	No. Please wait here.

Zuko enters the village with his men.

Zuko's soldier #1	Hurry, now!
Zuko's soldier #2	Secure the area.
Sokka	It can't be coincidence that we break him out of the ice, light shoots into the sky and now the Fire Nation is here with their machines.

Sokka reaches for his boomerang behind him, about to use it against Zuko.

Katara	Sokka, don't.

Zuko takes off his helmet before addressing the villagers.

Zuko	I am Prince Zuko ... son of Fire Lord Ozai and heir to the throne! Bring me ... all your elderly!
Child villager	Papa!
Zuko's soldier #3	Move!
Villager	Yeah?
Katara	Grandma!
Villager	Please don't ... don't harm him!
Zuko's Soldier	Come on!
The soldiers then took out several elderly villagers, including Kanna, the grandmother of Sokka and Katara. Furious, Katara was about to use her waterbending.

Sokka	Katara, don't.
Zuko's soldier #4	Form a line
Zuko's soldier #5	Come on!
Zuko's soldier #6	Here.
Villager	Hey.
Child villager	Grammy!

One of the soldiers finds Aang in the igloo with some children. Upon noticing his tattoos, he is brought to Zuko. Zuko is astonished to find the tattoos that he seemingly recognized its significance.

Aang	You're scaring these people.
Zuko	Who are you? What's your name!?
Aang	I don't need to tell you anything.
Zuko	Firebenders! [Zuko's soldiers move into positions.] I'm taking you to my ship. If you don't come, I'll burn down this village.
Aang	I'll go with you. Don't hurt anyone.

Aang follows Zuko and his men to the ship. The villagers move closer when a firebender sends out flame over their heads. Sokka and the villagers duck. They helplessly watch Aang being taken away. Cut to the igloo.

Sokka	They were looking for someone old and they were looking for someone with the same markings the boy had.
Katara	They dragged Mom away the same way when we were babies. She wouldn't have watched us being taken away. She would have fought. We found that boy. He's our responsibility. We should fight. What would you do if they tried to take me away?
Sokka	I'd kill them all.
Katara	Why?
Sokka	Because you're my sister. Because Dad told me to protect you with my life.
Katara	Because I'm your responsibility. And this boy is our responsibility.
Sokka	What do you want us to do, Katara? How are we supposed to save him? They're on a ship. We'd need a miracle to catch them. I know you think everything's going to work out, but I don't.

Appa wails louder and louder. When Sokka and Katara hear the sound of laughing children, they immediately go outside to see what is going on. The bison creature floats in the air as if wanting to follow his master, but is held back out of concern of the children hanging dangerously off his feet.

Katara	His bison creature thing floats.

Zuko's ship moves across the icy waters. Aang is kept in a room. The door opens, and Iroh and Zuko walk in. Iroh is amazed to see a young surviving airbender.

Aang	What do you want with me?
Iroh	My nephew wants me to perform a little test on you.
Aang	What kind of test?
Iroh	I assure you, it won't hurt. I've performed it hundreds of times. It only takes a few moments. And then you're free to go. Would you mind if I put a few things in front of you at the table? It will only take a moment.
Aang	That's all you want?
Iroh	My name is Iroh, and you have my word.

Cut to Sokka and Katara in the igloo with Katara's grandmother, Kanna.

Katara	Grandma, I know you're gonna try to stop us, but this is just something I need ...
Kanna	Sit down. [They sit.] I knew from the first time we discovered you were a bender, that one day, I would realize your destiny. There hasn't been a waterbender in the Southern Water Tribe since my friend Hama was taken away. Today, I found out that destiny. Did you see that boy's tattoos?

Sokka and Katara nod.

Kanna	Tattoos like that haven't been seen in over a century. I believe they are airbending tattoos.
Katara	How can that be?
Kanna	I believe that little boy might be the Avatar. [Pulls out a map of the world.] Once, a long time ago, the Spirit World kept balance over us.
Katara	What is the Spirit World, Grandma?
Kanna	It's not a place made up of things you can touch. But it exists, nonetheless. It is filled with the most amazing forms of dazzling creatures ... that exist in the most exotic valleys, mountains and forests. Each of these creatures is a Spirit. They've watched over us since the beginning. They have guided us. And only the Avatar can go speak to them.
Katara	Aren't there Spirits here?
Kanna	Yes, there are some Spirits that live hidden among us, sure they're watching us with great sadness ... the Fire Nation doesn't wish to live by the Spirits. That's why they're so frightened by the existence of the Avatar.
Katara	What can he do?
Kanna	With his mastery of the four elements, he will begin to change hearts. And it is in the heart that all wars are won. Now, go help this boy. He will need you two. And we all need him.

Zuko's uncle, Iroh, conducted a few test on Aang, after assuring him the test would be painless and once complete, he would be free to go. The test involved a candle flame that seemed to be drawn toward to him, a poured water that formed a circle on the table and a smooth rock that stood on an unstable position.

Zuko	You are my prisoner ... airbender. I'm taking you back to the Fire Nation.
Aang	You said ...
Iroh	I apologize. I should have explained further. If you failed the test, as all others did, you were free to leave. But, as it turns out, you are the only one in the entire world who could pass this test. It is truly an honor to be in your presence.
Zuko	Don't even try to escape. This is a warship ...!
Aang leaps over the table and over Zuko and Iroh, then lands behind them. He propels himself backward with airbending through an open door.
Zuko	Stop! There's no way you can ...
Aang uses airbending to close the door, trapping Zuko and Iroh inside as it can only be opened from the outside. The three guards outside se Aang then approach slowly to capture him. Aang pins them against the well with airbending, then goes to the upper deck, grabbing his staff along the way. Out in the open sea, he looks around, then sees Appa landing at a distant icy cliff
Zuko manages to get out of the holding room and came to the upper deck with his men. Aang spun around and turned his staff into a glider.

Zuko	Don't move! You have nowhere to run!

Aang then races across the deck to the bow of the ship, chased by Zuko and his men.

Zuko's soldier #7	Halt!
Zuko's soldier #8	Don't let him escape!
Zuko's soldier #9	Get him!

Aang jumps off the bow. Instead of a splash in the ocean, he appears gliding up to the cliff as Zuko and his men watch in amazement. Aang reunites with his bison creature, with Katara and Sokka.

Aang	Thanks for bringing Appa to me. The Fire Nation is up to something. I have to go back now.
Sokka	We'll come with you.
Aang	I can take you back to the village.
Katara	We're going with you.

Appa flies off the cliff, out of range as Zuko watches in despair.

Iroh	You found the Avatar.
Zuko	For a moment, I had my honor back.
Iroh	Your destinies are tied, Zuko. That, you can be sure of.



Act II (a), The Avatar Returns

Katara	[Narrating.] Aang flew us to his home. He told us how he left there in a storm on Appa, and got forced into the ocean where they almost drowned. Aang airbent a sphere around them, and ice formed. And he couldn't remember anything after that.

Aang, Sokka, and Katara arrive at the Southern Air Temple on the high mountains.

Aang	Hey, Chinto! Monae! I'm back! Hey, guys! I want you to meet someone!
Katara	This is where you live?
Aang	They must be playing some trick or something. Monk Gyatso is gonna try and jump out and scare me at any moment. He's the teacher responsible for me. [Jumps down.] He's kind of like my father.
Katara	Is it okay if you tell me your name?
Aang	The monks named me Aang. [Leads them into the Temple area.] Okay, guys! Enough!

A flying lemur flies toward Aang.

Sokka	Spider rat! They're poisonous! Get behind me.
Aang	He's a flying lemur-bat. We keep them as pets.
Katara	Weren't they extinct a long time ago?
Aang	Extinct? No, there must be thousands of them on this mountain.
Katara	Your friends were monks?
Aang	I know where they are right now. They're at the prayer field.

Aang races across the player field, goes down a flight of steps.

Katara	Aang, wait! I have to talk to you!

Aang is shocked to see human remains and an unkempt field.

Katara	Aang ... I think you were in that ice for almost a hundred years. The firebenders started a war.
Aang	I left a few days ago.
Katara	Aang, the Fire Nation knew the Avatar would be born into the Air Nomads ... so they exterminated all the Air Nomads.
Aang	[Words echoing through the entire area.] You're lying! [Finds a necklace on one of the remains.] This is Monk Gyatso's. I made it for him.

Aang has flashbacks to when he first gave the necklace to Gyatso.

Aang	Nooooooooo ...!

In his rage, his eyes and tattoos glow pure white and strong winds begins to circle around him, lifting him up.

Sokka	Katara! Stay away from him!

Aang is in trance and enters the Spirit World.

Sokka	[Echo.] Katara! Stay away from him!
Katara	[Echo.] Your friends were monks?

Aang walks into a cave. While looking around inside, a head of a dragon pops out from the mist.

Dragon Spirit	The Avatar? Where have you been?
Katara	[Echo.] Aang! You can't bring Monk Gyatso back, but Sokka and I can be with you as long as you need! Don't give up! We can do this together! Aang.

Aang leaves his trance and exited Spirit World. Aang opened his eyes. Katara was behind him.
Zhao spots Zuko on his ship out in the sea.

Zhao	The banished prince. Let's offer him lunch.

Cut scene to the mess hall on the Zhao's ship. Zuko and Iroh sat with Zhao on the main table, in front of Zhao's men in the hall

Zhao	I wanted to thank the great General Iroh and young Prince Zuko for dining with us. As you know, the Fire Lord has banished his son, the prince, and renounced his love of him, and will not let him return to the throne unless he finds the Avatar. The Fire Lord believes his son is too soft, and by doing this, he will become strong and become a worthy heir to the throne.
Zuko subconsciously bends a flame from a candle on the table. Iroh notices this, then holds his hand to calm him down.
Zhao	I commend the Fire Lord's discipline. For example, it seems I need to remind Prince Zuko that, during his banishment, he is an enemy of the Fire Nation and is not allowed to wear the Fire Nation uniform. But we will let him wear it today, like a child wearing a costume.
Zuko	[Stands up and whispers to Zhao.] One day, my father will take me back and you will bow before me.

Zuko storms off the mess hall. Iroh stands up and follows him. Back on his ship, Zuko gazes at his family picture (his mother, his father, his sister and himself) before has begins his training of firebending and hand-to-hand combat with four firebenders. Iroh observes from the deck above, while drinking his tea.
Appa lands in a forest in the Southern Earth Kingdom, where Katara, Sokka and Aang set up camp. Momo, the winged lemur, has become. Aang sits alone making sense of what he saw at the temple and the Spirit World.

Katara	You okay?
Aang	I'll be fine.
Katara	You know, my grandma thinks because you're an airbender, that you could be the Avatar.
Aang	How much does the Fire Nation control?
Katara	A lot of villages in the Earth Kingdom, like around here. They haven't been able to conquer big cities, like Ba Sing Se, but they're making plans, I'm sure.
Sokka	So ... are you the Avatar, Aang?

A young boy bursts out of the woods and seeks refuge with the trio from the Fire Nation soldiers chasing him.

Sokka	What is this?
Katara	Stay hidden.
Lead Fire Nation soldier	That child is being arrested.
Katara	For what?
Lead Fire Nation soldier	He was bending tiny stones at us from behind a tree. It really hurt.
Katara	He can bend earth?
Lead Fire Nation soldier	Earthbending is forbidden in this village.
Katara	Leave him alone. You're not taking him anywhere.
Sokka	No one ... is taking anybody away!
Katara pops open her water pouch and bends the water at the soldiers.
Lead Fire Nation soldier	She's a bender!

The water traps Sokka's arms and chest in ice instead, much to his frustration.

Sokka	Katara!

The soldiers arrest Sokka, Katara, Aang and the young earthbending boy. As they are taken to the prison camp just outside a village, Aang notices the poor condition of the village and its people. They are shoved through a gateway of a tall metal fence.

Fire Nation Prison guard	Move. You, too.

In the prison yard, there are men on the ground, weary and defeated. The earthbending boy has reunited with his father.

Earthbending boy	Dad!
Earthbending boy	This is my father.
Earthbending father	Hello.
Sokka	That's the Fire Nation's plan, suppress all other bending.
Aang	How did this happen to your village?
Earthbending father	Fire Nation sent soldiers. We fought them and defeated them. Then they sent their machines, huge machines made of metal. There was nothing we could do. Those who could not bend were allowed to live in peace, if we were imprisoned.
Aang	Earthbenders! Why are you acting this way? You are powerful and amazing people! You don't need to live like this! There is earth right beneath your feet. The ground ... is an extension of who you are!

The earthbenders are dismissive and non-responsive

Aang	If the Avatar had returned ... would that mean anything to you?
Earth Kingdom prisoner	The Avatar is dead. If he was here, he would protect us.
Aang	My name is Aang ... and I am the Avatar. [Unhoods himself to reveal his airbending tattoos.] I ran away, but I'm back now. It's time for you to stop doing this!
Fire Nation prison guard	The Avatar would have to be an airbender. Are you an airbender, boy?

Katara angrily pushes the soldier away.

Katara	Leave him alone!

The prison guard was furious, then tries to grab Katara, but Aang uses airbending to push him away

Fire Nation head prison guard	How is he doing that?
Aang	I don't want to hurt anyone.
Fire Nation head prison guard	All airbenders should be dead. Kill him! Firebenders, positions!
Sokka	Okay! Everybody can help us now!

The earthbending boy throws a pebble behind the lead soldier; he turns and bends a flame from the nearby fire pit at the boy. The father raises an earth barrier to protect his son. The other earthbenders watch the event unfold and rise with renewed sense of hope.

Katara	Don't be afraid!

Seeking to restore order, the lead soldier with another firebender launches a large flame toward the father and the boy, but it is blocked by a larger barrier, which six earthbenders raise in unison. Another earthbender raises a rock and accelerates it at the other soldier, and earth-blocks a flame attack from the lead soldier. Sokka takes down the lead soldier while Aang takes out another. After a few more airbending moves from Aang and a boomerang attack thrown by Sokka, the remaining soldiers retreat. Outside the prison, Aang takes out a few more soldiers in the village. After everything is settled, the villagers break open a shed holding all tools related to bending.

Old man of Kyoshi Town	They took away any tools related to bending.

Momo goes in the shed and knocks over a waterbending scroll. A villager picks up the scroll and gave it to Katara.

Kyoshi villager	The Fire Nation took this scroll from a member of your Water Tribe.
Katara	A waterbending scroll. This is rare. My mom told me about these.
Aang is taken to the statue of Avatar Kyoshi
Old man of Kyoshi Town	This was you when you were born an earthbender, two lifetimes ago. You came to our village. Avatar Kyoshi loved games.
Aang	I do, too. I mean, I still do.
Aang later met with Sokka and Katara.
Sokka	A lot of the villages in this part of the Earth Kingdom are occupied by the Fire Nation, like this village was. They prey on the weakest towns and villages. We should go visit some of these towns, Aang.
Aang	I need to tell you something.
Katara	What is it, Aang?
Aang	I ran away before they trained me to be the Avatar. I don't know how to bend the other elements.
Katara	Why did you run away?
Aang	The day they told me I was the Avatar, they said I could never have a normal life, that I could never have a family. They said it cannot work with the responsibilities of the Avatar.
Katara	Why can't the Avatar have a family?
Aang	I asked that! They said that's the sacrifice the Avatar always has to make.
Sokka	Okay. So, what if we found you teachers. Teachers to teach you bending? Which element would you have to learn first?
Aang	Water. Water comes after air in the cycle. Air, water, earth, fire.
Sokka	But there are really powerful benders in the Northern Water Tribe. My dad told me about it before he left. It's led by a princess because her father died. There are teachers there, but all the way on the other side of the world.
Aang	We can get there on Appa.
Sokka	That's what I was thinking. And maybe we can stop in the villages on the way, start a change in The War in these small villages. Should we try it?
Aang	Yes, we should.

The team of Aang, Sokka, Katara, Momo and Appa, set out on the journey to the north. Along the way they visit the villages, where Aang announces the Avatar had returned. In villages that were still occupied by Fire Nation soldiers, Aang uses his airbending to defeat them and liberate the village from their grip.
Meanwhile, Zuko and two soldiers, disguised as travelers of the Earth Kingdom, visit the first village Aang liberated. They also enter the former prison camp and look around.



Act II (b), The Blue Spirit

Katara	[Narrating.] The scroll we had was proving to be helpful. Aang was practicing, but for some reason, he was having trouble with waterbending. We moved from town to town in the Earth Kingdom. We tried to stay out of sight, but Sokka became concerned we were being followed.

On Zhao's flagship, a soldier enters the war room and whispers some information to Zhao. Later, at the Fire Nation palace, Zhao meets with Ozai.

Zhao	Sire, I have good news. As you know, I conducted a raid on the Great Library, which most said didn't exist.
Ozai	Get on with it.
Zhao	I found scrolls in the library. We are deciphering them. But I believe they may contain information as to where the Ocean and Moon Spirits live in this world. With this information, we could bring down the Northern Water Tribe city, we could show the world the true strength of fire.
Ozai	I am pleased. Well, Commander Zhao, are the rumors true or not?
Zhao	Our spies have discovered someone claiming to be the Avatar. They describe him as just a boy. We should set a trap for this person. We have many Earth Kingdom people under our control. I can leave soldiers hidden in certain locations.
Ozai	And my son?
Zhao	He had his chance. He missed it.
Ozai	Let's hope, for your sake, my son doesn't find this person first and he turns out to be the Avatar. He would return as a hero and, for all purposes, be your superior.
Zhao	Well, I suppose it's a race, then.

At the Fire Nation Colony Fifteen located in the Northern Earth Kingdom, Zuko sat with his uncle Iroh sat in a tea shop, with his face hidden by the hood of his cloak to avoid being recognized.

Zuko	We're close, Uncle. They've been moving farther and farther north. We're catching them.
Iroh	There are a lot of pretty girls in this town, Zuko. You could fall in love here. We could settle down here, and you could have a blessed life. We don't have to continue this, Zuko.
Zuko	I'll show you why we must, Uncle. Hey. Hey. Little one, come here.
Zuko	You look like a very smart boy. Tell me what you know about the prince, the Fire Lord's son.
Teahouse Child	He did something wrong.
Zuko	He spoke out of turn to a general, in defense of some of his friends who were going to be sacrificed in a battle.
Teahouse Child	Then Prince Zuko was sentenced to an Agni Ki duel, but when he showed up, it was his father he was to fight.
Zuko	That's right.
Teahouse Child	He would not fight his father.
Zuko	Then his father mocked him and said, "I should bring your sister up here to beat you."
Teahouse child	Then the father burnt his son ... to teach him a lesson. [Leaves.]
Zuko	[Turning to his uncle.] We'll catch him soon, Uncle. Then we can think about the pretty girls.
At the shore of a sparking lake beside a forest, Katara and Aang practiced waterbending while Sokka tended to a campfire nearby.
Katara	Aang ... try to keep your wrist bent, like it's showing.
Katara	What's wrong? You've really been distracted today.
Aang	I saw Sokka's maps. We're near the Northern Air Temple. Do you think it would be okay if I just visited there and came back? I'd be back in less than a day.

Later, Katara filled in Sokka in on what Aang wanted to do.

Sokka	Why?
Katara	He had a vision at the Southern Air Temple prayer field. He talked to a Dragon Spirit who he thinks can help us. He thinks if he goes to another spiritual place, he can get back to the Spirit World.
Sokka	I don't think that's a good idea. We started a rebellion. Try to talk him out of it.

Aang continued practicing waterbending in the dark, while Sokka and Katara were sleeping. He managed to raise the three short pillars of water. As he closes his eyes concentrating, ripples and waves began to form on the lake. He remembers Gyatso giving lessons to him and the other students in the open field and then images of skeletal remains he saw earlier. When he opened his eyes, he was surprised to see the result of his lack of control over waterbending.

Aang	I can't do this. I need help.

Convinced that Aang needed help immediately from the Dragon Spirit, he woke up Appa to head over to the Northern Air Temple. Sokka and Katara woke up and saw him took off. She assured Sokka that Aang will back in a day, but Sokka was concerned the Fire Nation might catch him.

Sokka	I guess your talk didn't work.
Katara	He'll be back in a day.
Sokka	The Fire Nation is following us. If we make a wrong move, they'll catch him.

Appa lands at the Northern Air Temple. As Aang makes his way in the temple ruins, he finds an old man.

Old man in temple	Who are you? Why, it cannot be! I've heard stories. Are you?
Aang	My name is Aang.
Old man in temple	I cannot believe I've lived to see your return. I'm an earth villager, but I visit these temple remains often.
Aang	The Fire Nation destroyed this temple. They have ruined everything.
Old man in temple	No, no, no, not everything. You know, there's a hidden chamber of statues I think you, of all people, should see. [Leads Aang to a hidden chamber of statues of past Avatars.] These are all the Avatars. These are the reincarnations of you over the years. The Avatar Roku was your last life. Now, how did the airbenders know you were the Avatar, little one?
Aang	They gave me a test. They put 1,000 toys in front of me and asked me to choose four. They said I chose the same four objects that belonged to the previous Avatars. That's when they told me I could have no family. Told me I had a responsibility to the Four Nations. There's a ceremony when everyone bows to me. That's when I accept my role as the Avatar. But when everyone bowed ... I didn't bow back.
Old man in temple	You seem like a nice young man. You really do. You will forgive me, won't you?
Aang	For what?
Old man in temple	For luring you down here.

Confused, Aang turns to see him surrounded by Fire Nation archers hiding behind the statues.

Old man in temple	I have lived in poverty because of your absence, Avatar. So you will understand my actions today.
O
ther Fire Nation soldiers poured into the chamber – one of them passed the old man a pouch of money as a reward. Unable to escape, Aang resigned himself to surrender.
Aang is later hung from chains in a prayer room in the Northern Air Temple. Aang closes his eyes and entered the Spirit World.

Old man in temple	[Echo.] I have lived in poverty because of your absence, Avatar.

Aang finds his way back to cave and meets the Dragon Spirit again.

Dragon Spirit	I have seen a vision of the moon turning red. The Fire Nation has stolen knowledge of us from the Great Library. They are planning to misuse this knowledge.
Aang	I will stop them.
Dragon Spirit	You must go to the Northern Water Tribe. If they take that city, more will suffer and die, as your airbenders have. You must go now
Aang	Will I stop them?

Aang is forcibly pulled from the Spirit World, being woken up by Zhao.

Zhao	Wake up, young man. My name is Commander Zhao. I set this trap for you. Don't worry, I'm not gonna kill you. Besides, you'd just be reborn again, and then the search would continue. So where have you been all this time? And how is it that you're still a boy? I understand that when you freed that handful of towns, you were very impressive, but ... you only used airbending against my soldiers. Now, why is that?

Later, a Fire Nation tank rolls on the bridge that connects to the temple. A blue-masked figure hitches a ride by grabbing onto its undercarriage. Zhao addresses his assembly of soldiers in the courtyard.

Zhao	The Fire Lord and I have a plan to ensure our reign and the downfall of our enemies. I am sending a personal message to the Fire Lord, informing him that the once feared Avatar is our prisoner and no threat to our might.

The figure heads toward the prayer room, stealthily taking down the soldiers posted along the way there. He enters the prayer room.

Aang	Who are you?

The figure pulls his dual swords about the strike.

Aang	Wait! Don't ...!

The figure severs the chains. Aang falls down on the floor and holds up his chained hands.

Aang	Stop!

The figure cuts the cuffs off Aang's hand. He gives Aang's staff back then motions Aang to follow him. Zhao and his assistant head toward the prayer room when he discovers the downed soldiers.

Zhao	Fools.

His assistant quickly runs back upstairs to alert the other soldiers.

Zhao's assistant	Close the inner gates! The Avatar has escaped!

Aang uses airbending to knock two soldiers block his path. He enters the temple courtyard with the blue-masked figure, referred by the soldiers as the Blue Spirit. They are surrounded by many Fire Nation soldiers.

Fire Nation soldier #1	Lock down the gate!
Fire Nation soldier #2	Lock down all the gates!

A fire attack from behind forces them to evade and split up, fighting the soldiers on the opposite sides on the courtyard. Aang ends up in the practice area.

Fire Nation soldier	To the main post!
Aang	This was their practice area.
Fire Nation Soldier	Go again!

Aang uses the airbending practice area to take out the soldiers, then leaps out of the courtyard and ran on the stepping pillars that the soldiers are unable to follow. Aang prepares to fly out using his staff-glider but seeing the Blue Spirit still fending off the soldiers by himself, Aang flies back to fight alongside him.

Zhao	Do not kill the Avatar! He will just be reborn again!

The Blue Spirit quickly grabs Aang and threateningly holds his sword at Aang's throat.

Zhao	Why are you doing this? Who are you?

Zhao notices a human mouth behind the blue mask.

Zhao	Open the gates. Let them out.

The soldiers remained at the courtyard while the Blue Spirit led Aang across the bridge. Zhao head up on a high balcony.

Lead Archer	Is it some kind of Spirit, Commander?
Zhao	Not at all. [Turns his head to the Lead Archer.] Do it.

At the end of the bridge, Zhao's archer shoots down the Blue Spirit with single arrow. The soldiers rush across the bridge to capture them. Aang discovers the unconscious Blue Spirit was Zuko. He uses airbending to pull in the fog and mask their getaway.

Zhao	What is this?

Once the fog clears, Aang and the Blue Spirit are nowhere to be found.
Aang takes care of Zuko till the next morning, then left Zuko still unconscious by the camp-fire in the forest, leaping from tree to tree.

A few days later, Zhao arrives at the Fire Nation palace, being summoned into the throne room.

Ozai	And how did he escape?
Zhao	I fear that your son is not only incompetent, but also a traitor. Of course, I cannot prove this, sire.
Ozai	You think ... my son is this person the soldiers are calling the Blue Spirit.
Zhao	Yes.

Back in the Northern Earth Kingdom, Iroh relaxes and receives a foot message from an earth villager woman when Zuko walks past him.

Iroh	Zhao's men were searching the coast, looking for you. They also searched the ship. I told them you went on vacation with a girl. Where were you for the past four days?
Zuko	Nowhere. We have to keep moving. The Avatar is traveling again.
Iroh	Take rest first. It looks like you went through a great deal. When you wake, we'll have tea together before we start the engines.
Ozai	[Voice-over.] Do not harm my son. Leave him to his isolation.
Zhao	[Voice-over.] You have my word, sire. I will not harm him.

As Zuko lay down on his bed in his ship, he notices something hissing near the torch on his wall. Zuko dashes out just before the ship explodes into a huge, orange fireball. Iroh moves in to protect the woman from the blast as he cries out to Zuko.

Iroh	Zuko!

Cut to Appa (carrying Aang and the others) swimming toward the Northern Water Tribe.

Ozai	[Voice-over.] And what of the Avatar?

Cut back to Ozai's throne room.

Zhao	We assume he has rejoined with his supporters. It has been confirmed that he's traveling north. It is my strong belief that he is traveling to the Northern Water Tribe.

Aang and the others find waterbenders practicing in the open water. Sokka waves at them. They are led to the city of the Northern Water Tribe.

Zhao	[Voice-over.] I believe the child Avatar has only knowledge of his birth element, air. I believe he is trying to learn in the discipline of water. He's gone to seek out someone in the Northern Water Tribe, where they have lived beyond our reach and openly practice waterbending.

Aang and the others are led into the city, the entranced seals shut behind them with waterbending.



Act III, The Siege of the North

Katara	[Narrating.] We arrived at the Northern Water Tribe. We presented ourselves to the royal court. My brother and the princess became friends right away. Aang showed them he was the last airbender, and was accepted to train with the master. The city knew our arrival would bring great danger. And they prepared for war they knew would come in the ensuing weeks.

Pakku lays out their defense strategy to Yue, with Sokka by her side.

Pakku	The city was designed to withstand any assault. If we keep them to the courtyard and the marketplace till night falls, where we have the advantage, we will succeed. If we let too many of them into the city, their sheer numbers could overwhelm us. As many fires in this city should be put out as possible when the alarm sounds. We want to minimize their bender sources. I must assign a guard to be with you at all times, Princess. Your presence is our inspiration.
Sokka	I'll do it. That's me. I'll be her guard. Nothing will happen to her.
Pakku	I had a feeling you might volunteer.

At the Fire Nation palace.

Ozai	I've heard no word of my son for quite some time. Do you know where he is?
Zhao	I've not heard of anything, sire. I'm sure word of him will come to us soon.
Ozai	The Northern Water Tribe benders are given their strength by the Moon and Ocean Spirits. They will be difficult to defeat. Now, if for some reason the Spirits were not involved, that would be different. What have you learned from the stolen scrolls?
Zhao	We have deciphered the location of the Moon and Ocean Spirits.
Ozai	It is our destiny ... to have found this information, Zhao. Eliminate the Spirits. Take the city and we will have thwarted the Avatar in the process.

The Fire Nation fleet is later seen leaving the ports, heading out to the city.
Katara and Aang has attend a waterbending class taught by Pakku.

Pakku	Water is what?
Students	The flowing element. The element of change.
Pakku	To master water, you must release your emotions, wherever they may lead you. Water teaches us acceptance. Let your emotions flow like water. [To Aang.] Aang, would you like to spar? You haven't sparred in a few days.

Pakku encases Aang in an icy prison; Aang gracefully waterbends the ice away. Pakku sends him three water balls, which Aang successful catches in mid-air and disperses.

Pakku	Now, use offense, Aang

Aang attempts an offensive move as instructed, but he only manages to raise droplets of water and inadvertently raises the waters in the nearby canals. Aang stops, realizing his still lack control over his incredible waterbending ability, as Pakku and the students watch in astonishment.
On the Fire Nation flagship that leads the rest of fleet, Iroh meets with Zhao on the upper deck.

Zhao	General Iroh, I'm glad you could accept my invitation to join us on this historic event.
Iroh	Your invitation was most gracious.
Zhao	You are a gifted strategist. No one can argue that. Your failure in the Hundred Day Siege of Ba Sing Se won't be held against you. Your son died in that siege, didn't he?
Iroh	Yes, he did.
Zhao	Again, I offer my condolences on your nephew burning to death in that terrible accident.
Iroh	Thank you.

Sokka and Yue spend some time enjoy each other's company.

Yue	I've loved spending these weeks with you, Sokka.
Sokka	Me, too.
Yue	Should we see what the ocean is doing today?

They head over to the fort walls for the ocean view.

Yue	When there is some safety for all of us, I will come visit our sister city in the Southern Water Tribe and spend some time in your home.
Sokka	That would be great. But I warn you ... my grandmother will ask you a lot of questions.
Yue	What might she ask me?
Sokka	She'll say, "Why is your hair white, young lady? You look very odd."
Yue	I would say to your grandmother, my hair is white because when I was born, I was not awake. My mother and father could not get me to make a sound or move. So they prayed for days to the Moon Spirit and dipped me into the sacred waters. My parents said that my hair turned white then and life poured into me.
Sokka	Wow. You didn't tell me that.
Yue	You didn't ask me. Only your grandmother did.

Iroh went below deck and met with Zuko, who was still alive.

Iroh	I'm sure Zhao was the one who ordered the attack on you.
Zuko	Any problems?
Iroh	We have arrived at the Northern Water Tribe's stronghold. They believe the boy is there.
Zuko	Why do you seem upset, Uncle?
Iroh	Zhao has no sacredness. Are you sure you want to be here?
Zuko	I will not be allowed to live in peace until I bring the Avatar to my father! Is that not clear to you?

Aang and Katara practice their waterbending forms when the black ashes fall all over the city.

Yue	[Confused.] What is this?
Sokka	Yue ... the Fire Nation is here.

The ashes came from the burning engines of the Fire Nation ships. At the rear of Zhao's flagship, Zuko wearing a white camouflage suit stepped into a small boat.

Iroh	Now be sure to keep your uniform closed up to your neck. And remember, your Chi can warm you.
Zuko	I know, Uncle.
Iroh	Be safe.

Zuko heads out near the shore of the stronghold, then dive in. He finds a spot underneath the city with thin layer of ice, then generates heat from his chi to melt the spot and breaks through the surface, into an unoccupied room.
Sokka takes Aang into the balcony room, to see Yue, who oversees the Fire Nation armada with Katara.

Katara	Aang needs to ask you something.
Aang	I have to talk to the Dragon Spirit. He can help me defeat the Fire Nation. Is there a spiritual place where I can meditate?
Yue	There is a very spiritual place. The city was built around this place. But we must hurry.

Yue leads Aang, Katara, and Sokka to the place. Zuko notices them from the rooftops, and follows them to an entrance into the side of a icy hill. Inside, they step into a spiritual cave with an oasis pond. In the middle of the pond is a tree with a ground path leading to it. Momo reaches into the pond to touch one of the two fish, one black and the other white.

Aang	Momo, be nice.

Momo scampers and flies away.

Aang	To get your airbending tattoos, you have to meditate for long periods of time without losing focus. Some of the great monks can meditate for four days.

As Aang sits down to meditate near the tree, two fish swirl together in a circle and glow in their insides.

Yue	I have to get back.
Sokka	I'll take you.
Katara	I'll stay with him.

Sokka escorts Yue back while Katara stays with Aang as he meditates into a trance.

Katara	Aang? Aang, can you hear me? I knew you were real. I always knew you'd return.
Zuko	Me, too.
Katara	The Fire Lord's son. You took him from our village.

Zuko sets his torch down to set the grass on fire, as Katara takes a defensive stance. Zuko sends out a fire blast, which she takes out with two large stream with water from the pond. With the second blast, Katara takes it out with a single stream. Zuko is surprised and impressed of her waterbending ability.

Zuko	Who are you?
Katara	My name is Katara, and I'm the only waterbender left in the Southern Water Tribe.

Zuko then firebends a curved blast and a straight blast. Overwhelmed with the complexity of Zuko's attack, she deflects the curved blast but is knocked hard against the tree with the other blast.
As the large city bell was rung, the Northern Water Tribe residents hurriedly seek for shelter all over the city. Soldiers were seen lining up on the fort walls, overlooking the large Fire Nation fleet nearing its attack range. As Pakku gives out the battle cry, the soldiers rattled the end of their spears against the icy floor for morale.

Water Tribe civilian #1	Go for the children.
Water Tribe civilian #2	Yes.

Zuko rests Katara's unconscious body next to the tree and checks her condition.

Zuko	I'm not allowed to go home without him.

Northern Water Tribe soldiers and waterbenders are seen lining up on the fort walls, overlooking the large Fire Nation fleet nearing its attack range. As Pakku gives out the battle cry, the soldiers rattle the end of their spears against the icy floor for morale.
Iroh enters the war room on Zhao's ship.

Iroh	The waterbenders get power from the moon. They will get stronger as the day comes to an end.
Zhao	General Iroh, I've been keeping a secret.
Iroh	And what is that?
Zhao	In my raid of the Great Library earlier this year, I found a scroll that tells the location of the Ocean and Moon Spirits.
Iroh	To meet a Spirit would be a great honor.
Zhao	Well, I hope I can give you that honor.

The Fire Nation invasion of the Northern Water Tribe stronghold was fully underway. A firebender riding Komodo-Rhino stepped off the ship's platform and scaled up the icy fort walls. At the top, the firebender uses the fiery metal spheres catapulted from the ship to blast the city below. Spinning drills break through the surface at many locations within the city, where soldiers emerge from the sea below.
Sokka came back to the spiritual place with Yue, and found Katara lying unconscious near the tree. He woke her up.

Sokka	What happened?
Katara	Prince Zuko's here in the city. He took Aang again.

Elsewhere, Zuko places Aang down in a storage room in the stronghold, still in trance with his hands bound with rope. Zuko peers out the window, looking down the battle taking place below.

Zuko	We'll just wait till everyone's fighting everyone. Then in the night, we'll slip out.

Back to the point when Aang entered the Spirit World

Katara	[Voice-over.] Aang, can you hear me? I knew you were real. I always knew you'd return.

Aang sees the lanterns which leads him back to the cave again.

Aang	Hello! Hello! [Enters the cave and finds the Dragon Spirit inside.] Please, tell me how to beat the Fire Nation!
Dragon Spirit	You are not dealing with the loss of your people, and your responsibility for their deaths. You are stopping yourself from grieving. You are angry. You must let this go. As the Avatar, you are not meant to hurt others. [Slithers past Aang and out of the cave, but then peers back at Aang.] Use the ocean. Show them the power of water. Go! Do this now.

The Dragon spreads its mighty wings and lifts itself into the sky, as Aang leaves his trance.

Zuko	[Voice-over.] My sister Azula was always the special one. She was a firebending prodigy.

Aang finds himself hand bound in the storage room, and overhears Zuko talking while he is still looking out the window.

Zuko	My father loves her. He can't even look at me sometimes. He says I'm like my mother.

Aang takes off, leaping over barrels, with Zuko chasing right behind him. He firebends the flames from the torches to take Aang down, in the process blasting away items in the room.
Just outside the stronghold, a firebender concentrates a large flame through a nozzle on a ship to breach the fort wall. He succeeds in creating a hole, which is large enough for Fire Nation soldiers and Komodo rhino-riders to freely enter the city. Master Pakku waterbends the soldiers in the courtyard. Cut back to the flagship.

Iroh	I advise that you pull back your men soon. They will be trapped in the city when the moon's power comes out.
Zhao	Do not worry about the moon's power, General Iroh.
Iroh	Why should you not be worried about the moon's power?
Zhao	Because your brother, Fire Lord Ozai, and I have decided it is in our best interests to kill the Moon Spirit.
Iroh	What?

Zuko searches for Aang hiding in the storage room. His hands now free, Aang uses airbending to distract Zuko and tried to escape. The situation escalates to a fight, later with firebending and airbending.
Katara follows Sokka and Yue back into the city, with the battle ongoing.

Katara	Calm down. We'll find him.

Katara then sees the flames illuminating from the window of the storage room from the city below.
As the fight between Aang and Zuko turns into a standoff, they notice that room is rumbling. The water in the barrels begin to shake, then spirals to Zuko encasing him in ice. Aang turns to see Katara, who completes her waterbending move.

Katara	Are you okay? Did the Spirits tell you anything?
Aang	Yes. The Dragon Spirit talked to me. I know what to do.
Katara	Aang, we have to go.

Katara then left the room with Sokka and Yue. Aang peered out the window was astonished at the battle in the city. Before leaving the room, he melted the ice around Zuko's head so Zuko can breathe.

Aang	You won't be killed by waterbenders if you stay hidden here. [Walking to the doorway, he turns toward Zuko.] We could be friends, you know.

Zhao and Iroh enter the Water Tribe stronghold through the breach, flanked by Fire Nation soldiers. He uses the scroll from the Great Library to lead his men and Iroh to where they need to go.

Zhao	They're getting stronger. This is a scroll from the Great Library. This is our map. Our world is going to change soon, gentlemen.

Some soldiers approach the civilians.

Fire Nation soldier	Right there and right there.

The soldiers step back, seeing Appa growling at them.

Elsewhere, Aang heads toward the courtyard with Sokka, Yue and Katara, when he notices Zhao heading somewhere with the scroll in his hand.

Aang	See where they're going! I'll go join the fight!

Aang joins the fight in the main courtyard. Meanwhile, back at the storage room, Zuko uses his chi-heat to melt the ice and free himself. Elsewhere, Zhao and Iroh end up at the same spiritual place where Aang meditated.

Zhao	They are called many names: Yin and Yang, "push" and "pull". May I introduce you to the mysterious Ocean and Moon Spirits? [Scoops the white fish into his pouch.] Why do Spirits take the form of such benign things? It leaves them so vulnerable.
Iroh	To teach man kindness and humility.

Zhao prepares to kill the Moon Spirit.

Iroh	Commander Zhao, there are certain things humankind should not tamper with. The Spirits and the Spirit World is one of them.

Just then, Katara, Sokka, and Yue burst into the spiritual place.

Yue	What are you doing here?
Iroh	Stop, Zhao. The world will go out of balance. Everyone will be hurt.
Zhao	The Fire Nation, is, too powerful ... to worry about children's superstitions, General Iroh.
Iroh	Commander Zhao, don't.
Zhao	We are now the gods!

Zhao overcomes his hesitation and stabbed the fish with his dagger.

Iroh	No!

Yue collapses onto the grass, as if she was the one who was struck. Outside, pain shoots through Aang's head. The moon slowly turns red, casting a sickly crimson glow over the Northern city. The waterbenders lose their Moon enhanced powers.

Fire Nation soldier	All men, battle stations!

Cut back to the spiritual place.

Zhao	You are too soft, General Iroh.

In rage, Iroh creates large fires from his hands.

Fire Nation soldier	He's making fire out of nothing!

Zhao, unable to comprehend or combat this great power, turns and flees from the spiritual place, along with his men. Iroh lowers his hands and his flames die down and disappear.
With the Moon power gone, more Fire Nation soldiers pour into city through three breaches now made on the fort walls.

Water Tribe soldier	They're breaching the wall!
Water Tribe soldier	To the front!

Aang looks at the losing battle surrounding him, as the Dragon Spirit's words are heard again.

Dragon Spirit	[Echo.] As the Avatar, you are not meant to hurt others. You must show them the power of water.

At the spiritual place, Yue and the others grieved for the loss of the Moon spirit.

Yue	All is lost.
Iroh	You have been anointed by the Moon Spirit.
Yue	He gave me life when I was a child.
Iroh	Then there is still a chance. You can give your life back for the Spirit's.
Sokka	Don't listen to him, he's Fire Nation.
Iroh	Nothing is ever truly lost.
Yue	Is it mine to give back, if I choose?
Iroh	There are reasons each of us are born. We have to find those reasons.
Yue	This was the reason I was born.
Sokka	Yue, please.
Yue	There is no love without sacrifice.
Sokka	Yue, what are you doing? You don't know what will happen.
Yue	I believe my life force will leave my body and return to the Moon Spirit.
Sokka	And then what?
Yue	My soul will no longer exist in this form.
Sokka	Please don't do this. There must be another way. I can't let you do this. I'm supposed to protect you.
Yue	My people are dying, Sokka. Those who are in charge of others have a responsibility. It is time we show the Fire Nation we believe in our beliefs as much as they believe in theirs.
Sokka	But Yue ...
Yue	I'm scared. Don't make me any more scared. I will miss you more than you know.

She gives Sokka a final kiss and enters the pond. As her life force leaves her to revive the Moon spirit, her white hair turns black. There is a pause in battle when the Moon reverts back to its natural glow. Iroh lifts her lifeless body out of the pond and lays her down on the grass. Distraught, Sokka cries over her lifeless body.
Zhao is on a bridge, seemingly in despair of his failure of killing the Moon, when Zuko steps out from the mist, walking toward him.

Zhao	I killed you.

Zuko prepares to duel Zhao when Iroh appears.

Iroh	Come away from him, nephew. There are too many soldiers now. They will never let you take the Avatar. We must leave immediately. He wants to fight you so he can capture you, Zuko. Walk away. [Zuko stands his ground, staring at Zhao with deadly intensity.] Come!

Zuko turns and walks back toward Iroh. As they walk away, the enraged Zhao bends a large double-spiral fire attack to them. Iroh quickly steps in front of Zuko and redirects the flames to sides, shielding him and Zuko.

Iroh	You stand alone. And that has always been your great mistake.

They leave Zhao standing alone on the bridge. The flames had attracted the attention of four waterbenders, now blocking Zhao's path off the bridge. Outnumbered, Zhao had no way of escaping and no chance of defeating them, especially with the return of the Moon's power. Refusing to surrender, Zhao provoked the waterbenders by bending a fire shot that barely hit any of the waterbenders. He then took off his cloak and waited to be finished off. Four large stream of water bent from the river below engulfed Zhao into a water sphere, drowning him.
Aang races toward the fort wall, using waterbending to trap and stop Fire Nation soldiers along the way. He sends an airbending blast through the courtyard, opening a path through the battle forces, leading him right to the wall. At the top, he looks out at the vast Fire Nation fleet in the ocean.

Pakku	[Voice-over.] Water teaches us acceptance. Let your emotions flow like water.

He recalls images of his life with Gyatso and his friends, and then the fateful event where everyone bowed to him but ran away instead of bowing back. Freeing himself of his guilt, Aang used with the Ocean's power to push a massive body of water up against the fort wall, and Moon's power to pull it toward the sky. His eyes and tattoos glowed bluish-white as he unleashes "the power of water". The battle paused again at the incredible feat of waterbending. The Fire Nation soldiers in the city tried to retreat through a breach but it was blocked by the water. Aang bent the water toward the Fire Nation fleet but kept it hovering threateningly above them. Knowing that the water could easily crush the fleet, the Fire Nation accepted defeat and turned away. Aang bent the water back into the ocean and watched the fleet in retreat.

Katara	Aang?

Katara hugs Aang as he was cheered from the city below. She and Sokka help an exhausted Aang down the stairs into the courtyard. Aang sees the entire Northern Water Tribe waiting for him. They all kneel and bow before him. The remaining Fire Nation soldiers left in the city also bow, in awe of his power and moved by his show of mercy.

Katara	They want you to be their Avatar, Aang. We all do.

Katara and Sokka bow alongside the others. Finally accepting his role as the Avatar, Aang bows back.



Epilogue

The story closes with Ozai's exposition at the Fire Nation place, directed to his daughter Azula, who kneels before him.

Ozai	Our forces in the Northern Water Tribe have failed to take the city. General Zhao was killed in battle and my brother has become a traitor. My son's proven himself a failure. Now, Sozin's Comet is returning in three years. It will give all firebenders the ability of the highest firebenders, the ability to use their own Chi to create fire. That is the day we will win this war and prove the Fire Nation's dominance. Now you must stop the Avatar from mastering earth and fire. You must give us the time to get to that day. Do you accept this unspeakably important task I'm putting in your hands?
Azula	I do, Father.





Prologue

The film begins with metal letters reading 'The Last Airbender'. As they fade away, a silhouetted figure appears, who bends a blob of water from the bottom of the screen. Cut to another figure, who lifts a piece of earth out of the ground and kicks it away. Cut to a third figure, who manipulates a stream of fire with his hands and blasts it at camera. Cut to the final figure, who twirls around and blasts air at the camera.
Cut to a text crawl, which is narrated by Katara.

Katara	[Narrating.] A hundred years ago, all was right with our world. Prosperity and peace filled our days. The Four Nations: water, earth, fire and Air Nomads lived amongst each other in harmony. Great respect was afforded to all those who could bend their natural element. The Avatar was the only person born amongst all the nations who could master all four elements. He was the only one who could communicate with the Spirit World. With the Spirits' guidance, the Avatar kept balance in the world. [Continues with single text on screen.] And then, a hundred years ago, he just disappeared.



Act I, The Boy in the Iceberg

A screen of text appears, reading Book One: Water with the waterbending symbol below. It fades to a scene of water swishing gently back and forth. The camera pans to reveal Katara practicing her forms on the edge of the ice. She eventually levitates a small sphere of water out of the ocean and plays with it gently before accidentally tripping and sending it flying down off-screen. Sokka leaps up from off-screen, soaked from the impact.

Katara	I'm sorry. I'm sorry! Hey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry ...
Katara	I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Hey! It worked better that time.
Katara	I thought about Mom. Isn't that strange?
Sokka	Yeah. I guess so. Just stop doing that stuff around me. I always get wet.
Katara accompanies Sokka on a hunt for food for their tribe.
Katara	[Narrating.] My brother and I live in the Southern Water Tribe, which was once a big city. Our father is off fighting in The War. My mother was taken prisoner and killed when I was young. In this time of war, food is scarce. My brother and I often go hunting for food, but, unfortunately, my brother isn't the best hunter in the world.

Sokka follows the tiger seal tracks, leading them out to the vast open field of ice

Sokka	Tiger seal.
Katara	Are you sure?
Sokka	I did everything Dad said to do. I watched which side of the fin tracks are more indented. That shows which direction they're going. I saw how long the drag skids are. That shows you how fast they're going.
Katara	There's something under there.
Sokka uses his boomerang to crack the floor open but the cracks expand and start a cave-in.
Sokka	It's a cave-in! Move away from the cracks.

A large ice sphere emerges from the cracks with a silhouette of a person inside it.

Sokka	Katara, don't go near it. This is probably some Fire Nation trick. Just back away really slow.

As Sokka turns around, Katara grabs his boomerang and uses it to crack the sphere.

Sokka	Katara! Do not hit that sphere!

The ice sphere breaks part, shooting a bright light high to the sky, which catches the attention of Prince Zuko on a faraway ship

Zuko	Uncle, look!

In the resulting ice crater, Katara and Sokka slide down to discover a thirteen-year-old boy, Aang, alive but exhausted, with his large six-legged bison creature, Appa.

Katara	Is he breathing?
Sokka	Did you see that light shoot into the sky?
Katara	What's your name? How did you get here? How did you get in the ice? [The boy turns toward Katara but is too tired to speak.] He's exhausted. [To Sokka.] We need to get him back to the village.
Sokka	[Pokes around Appa, who is still sleeping.] What is this thing? [Appa's tail accidentally lands on top of Sokka.] It's trying to eat me!

Aang is taken back to the village where he soon recovered in an igloo. Appa follows them home off-screen, much to the amazement of the villagers

Villager	Look. See?

Katara enters the igloo where the boy was recovering. As he puts on his shirt, Katara sees the tattoos on his back

Katara	How'd you get all the way out here?
Aang	I ran away from home. We got in a storm. We were forced under the water of the ocean.
Katara	Oh, I see.
Aang	It wasn't very smart. I was just upset. Thanks for saving me.
Katara	Lucky.
Aang	I probably should get home. They'll all be worried.
Katara	You're not still upset?
Aang	Not as much as I was.

Outside, Zuko's ship smashes through the icy landscape toward the village. Sokka later leads a train of children into the igloo

Sokka	The Fire Nation is here.
Katara	What?
Sokka	And they brought their machines.

Katara was heading out of the igloo with Sokka, then turned to Aang

Sokka	Don't come out till I tell you it's safe.
Aang	Is something wrong?
Katara	No. Please wait here.

Zuko enters the village with his men.

Zuko's soldier #1	Hurry, now!
Zuko's soldier #2	Secure the area.
Sokka	It can't be coincidence that we break him out of the ice, light shoots into the sky and now the Fire Nation is here with their machines.

Sokka reaches for his boomerang behind him, about to use it against Zuko.

Katara	Sokka, don't.

Zuko takes off his helmet before addressing the villagers.

Zuko	I am Prince Zuko ... son of Fire Lord Ozai and heir to the throne! Bring me ... all your elderly!
Child villager	Papa!
Zuko's soldier #3	Move!
Villager	Yeah?
Katara	Grandma!
Villager	Please don't ... don't harm him!
Zuko's Soldier	Come on!
The soldiers then took out several elderly villagers, including Kanna, the grandmother of Sokka and Katara. Furious, Katara was about to use her waterbending.

Sokka	Katara, don't.
Zuko's soldier #4	Form a line
Zuko's soldier #5	Come on!
Zuko's soldier #6	Here.
Villager	Hey.
Child villager	Grammy!

One of the soldiers finds Aang in the igloo with some children. Upon noticing his tattoos, he is brought to Zuko. Zuko is astonished to find the tattoos that he seemingly recognized its significance.

Aang	You're scaring these people.
Zuko	Who are you? What's your name!?
Aang	I don't need to tell you anything.
Zuko	Firebenders! [Zuko's soldiers move into positions.] I'm taking you to my ship. If you don't come, I'll burn down this village.
Aang	I'll go with you. Don't hurt anyone.

Aang follows Zuko and his men to the ship. The villagers move closer when a firebender sends out flame over their heads. Sokka and the villagers duck. They helplessly watch Aang being taken away. Cut to the igloo.

Sokka	They were looking for someone old and they were looking for someone with the same markings the boy had.
Katara	They dragged Mom away the same way when we were babies. She wouldn't have watched us being taken away. She would have fought. We found that boy. He's our responsibility. We should fight. What would you do if they tried to take me away?
Sokka	I'd kill them all.
Katara	Why?
Sokka	Because you're my sister. Because Dad told me to protect you with my life.
Katara	Because I'm your responsibility. And this boy is our responsibility.
Sokka	What do you want us to do, Katara? How are we supposed to save him? They're on a ship. We'd need a miracle to catch them. I know you think everything's going to work out, but I don't.

Appa wails louder and louder. When Sokka and Katara hear the sound of laughing children, they immediately go outside to see what is going on. The bison creature floats in the air as if wanting to follow his master, but is held back out of concern of the children hanging dangerously off his feet.

Katara	His bison creature thing floats.

Zuko's ship moves across the icy waters. Aang is kept in a room. The door opens, and Iroh and Zuko walk in. Iroh is amazed to see a young surviving airbender.

Aang	What do you want with me?
Iroh	My nephew wants me to perform a little test on you.
Aang	What kind of test?
Iroh	I assure you, it won't hurt. I've performed it hundreds of times. It only takes a few moments. And then you're free to go. Would you mind if I put a few things in front of you at the table? It will only take a moment.
Aang	That's all you want?
Iroh	My name is Iroh, and you have my word.

Cut to Sokka and Katara in the igloo with Katara's grandmother, Kanna.

Katara	Grandma, I know you're gonna try to stop us, but this is just something I need ...
Kanna	Sit down. [They sit.] I knew from the first time we discovered you were a bender, that one day, I would realize your destiny. There hasn't been a waterbender in the Southern Water Tribe since my friend Hama was taken away. Today, I found out that destiny. Did you see that boy's tattoos?

Sokka and Katara nod.

Kanna	Tattoos like that haven't been seen in over a century. I believe they are airbending tattoos.
Katara	How can that be?
Kanna	I believe that little boy might be the Avatar. [Pulls out a map of the world.] Once, a long time ago, the Spirit World kept balance over us.
Katara	What is the Spirit World, Grandma?
Kanna	It's not a place made up of things you can touch. But it exists, nonetheless. It is filled with the most amazing forms of dazzling creatures ... that exist in the most exotic valleys, mountains and forests. Each of these creatures is a Spirit. They've watched over us since the beginning. They have guided us. And only the Avatar can go speak to them.
Katara	Aren't there Spirits here?
Kanna	Yes, there are some Spirits that live hidden among us, sure they're watching us with great sadness ... the Fire Nation doesn't wish to live by the Spirits. That's why they're so frightened by the existence of the Avatar.
Katara	What can he do?
Kanna	With his mastery of the four elements, he will begin to change hearts. And it is in the heart that all wars are won. Now, go help this boy. He will need you two. And we all need him.

Zuko's uncle, Iroh, conducted a few test on Aang, after assuring him the test would be painless and once complete, he would be free to go. The test involved a candle flame that seemed to be drawn toward to him, a poured water that formed a circle on the table and a smooth rock that stood on an unstable position.

Zuko	You are my prisoner ... airbender. I'm taking you back to the Fire Nation.
Aang	You said ...
Iroh	I apologize. I should have explained further. If you failed the test, as all others did, you were free to leave. But, as it turns out, you are the only one in the entire world who could pass this test. It is truly an honor to be in your presence.
Zuko	Don't even try to escape. This is a warship ...!
Aang leaps over the table and over Zuko and Iroh, then lands behind them. He propels himself backward with airbending through an open door.
Zuko	Stop! There's no way you can ...
Aang uses airbending to close the door, trapping Zuko and Iroh inside as it can only be opened from the outside. The three guards outside se Aang then approach slowly to capture him. Aang pins them against the well with airbending, then goes to the upper deck, grabbing his staff along the way. Out in the open sea, he looks around, then sees Appa landing at a distant icy cliff
Zuko manages to get out of the holding room and came to the upper deck with his men. Aang spun around and turned his staff into a glider.

Zuko	Don't move! You have nowhere to run!

Aang then races across the deck to the bow of the ship, chased by Zuko and his men.

Zuko's soldier #7	Halt!
Zuko's soldier #8	Don't let him escape!
Zuko's soldier #9	Get him!

Aang jumps off the bow. Instead of a splash in the ocean, he appears gliding up to the cliff as Zuko and his men watch in amazement. Aang reunites with his bison creature, with Katara and Sokka.

Aang	Thanks for bringing Appa to me. The Fire Nation is up to something. I have to go back now.
Sokka	We'll come with you.
Aang	I can take you back to the village.
Katara	We're going with you.

Appa flies off the cliff, out of range as Zuko watches in despair.

Iroh	You found the Avatar.
Zuko	For a moment, I had my honor back.
Iroh	Your destinies are tied, Zuko. That, you can be sure of.



Act II (a), The Avatar Returns

Katara	[Narrating.] Aang flew us to his home. He told us how he left there in a storm on Appa, and got forced into the ocean where they almost drowned. Aang airbent a sphere around them, and ice formed. And he couldn't remember anything after that.

Aang, Sokka, and Katara arrive at the Southern Air Temple on the high mountains.

Aang	Hey, Chinto! Monae! I'm back! Hey, guys! I want you to meet someone!
Katara	This is where you live?
Aang	They must be playing some trick or something. Monk Gyatso is gonna try and jump out and scare me at any moment. He's the teacher responsible for me. [Jumps down.] He's kind of like my father.
Katara	Is it okay if you tell me your name?
Aang	The monks named me Aang. [Leads them into the Temple area.] Okay, guys! Enough!

A flying lemur flies toward Aang.

Sokka	Spider rat! They're poisonous! Get behind me.
Aang	He's a flying lemur-bat. We keep them as pets.
Katara	Weren't they extinct a long time ago?
Aang	Extinct? No, there must be thousands of them on this mountain.
Katara	Your friends were monks?
Aang	I know where they are right now. They're at the prayer field.

Aang races across the player field, goes down a flight of steps.

Katara	Aang, wait! I have to talk to you!

Aang is shocked to see human remains and an unkempt field.

Katara	Aang ... I think you were in that ice for almost a hundred years. The firebenders started a war.
Aang	I left a few days ago.
Katara	Aang, the Fire Nation knew the Avatar would be born into the Air Nomads ... so they exterminated all the Air Nomads.
Aang	[Words echoing through the entire area.] You're lying! [Finds a necklace on one of the remains.] This is Monk Gyatso's. I made it for him.

Aang has flashbacks to when he first gave the necklace to Gyatso.

Aang	Nooooooooo ...!

In his rage, his eyes and tattoos glow pure white and strong winds begins to circle around him, lifting him up.

Sokka	Katara! Stay away from him!

Aang is in trance and enters the Spirit World.

Sokka	[Echo.] Katara! Stay away from him!
Katara	[Echo.] Your friends were monks?

Aang walks into a cave. While looking around inside, a head of a dragon pops out from the mist.

Dragon Spirit	The Avatar? Where have you been?
Katara	[Echo.] Aang! You can't bring Monk Gyatso back, but Sokka and I can be with you as long as you need! Don't give up! We can do this together! Aang.

Aang leaves his trance and exited Spirit World. Aang opened his eyes. Katara was behind him.
Zhao spots Zuko on his ship out in the sea.

Zhao	The banished prince. Let's offer him lunch.

Cut scene to the mess hall on the Zhao's ship. Zuko and Iroh sat with Zhao on the main table, in front of Zhao's men in the hall

Zhao	I wanted to thank the great General Iroh and young Prince Zuko for dining with us. As you know, the Fire Lord has banished his son, the prince, and renounced his love of him, and will not let him return to the throne unless he finds the Avatar. The Fire Lord believes his son is too soft, and by doing this, he will become strong and become a worthy heir to the throne.
Zuko subconsciously bends a flame from a candle on the table. Iroh notices this, then holds his hand to calm him down.
Zhao	I commend the Fire Lord's discipline. For example, it seems I need to remind Prince Zuko that, during his banishment, he is an enemy of the Fire Nation and is not allowed to wear the Fire Nation uniform. But we will let him wear it today, like a child wearing a costume.
Zuko	[Stands up and whispers to Zhao.] One day, my father will take me back and you will bow before me.

Zuko storms off the mess hall. Iroh stands up and follows him. Back on his ship, Zuko gazes at his family picture (his mother, his father, his sister and himself) before has begins his training of firebending and hand-to-hand combat with four firebenders. Iroh observes from the deck above, while drinking his tea.
Appa lands in a forest in the Southern Earth Kingdom, where Katara, Sokka and Aang set up camp. Momo, the winged lemur, has become. Aang sits alone making sense of what he saw at the temple and the Spirit World.

Katara	You okay?
Aang	I'll be fine.
Katara	You know, my grandma thinks because you're an airbender, that you could be the Avatar.
Aang	How much does the Fire Nation control?
Katara	A lot of villages in the Earth Kingdom, like around here. They haven't been able to conquer big cities, like Ba Sing Se, but they're making plans, I'm sure.
Sokka	So ... are you the Avatar, Aang?

A young boy bursts out of the woods and seeks refuge with the trio from the Fire Nation soldiers chasing him.

Sokka	What is this?
Katara	Stay hidden.
Lead Fire Nation soldier	That child is being arrested.
Katara	For what?
Lead Fire Nation soldier	He was bending tiny stones at us from behind a tree. It really hurt.
Katara	He can bend earth?
Lead Fire Nation soldier	Earthbending is forbidden in this village.
Katara	Leave him alone. You're not taking him anywhere.
Sokka	No one ... is taking anybody away!
Katara pops open her water pouch and bends the water at the soldiers.
Lead Fire Nation soldier	She's a bender!

The water traps Sokka's arms and chest in ice instead, much to his frustration.

Sokka	Katara!

The soldiers arrest Sokka, Katara, Aang and the young earthbending boy. As they are taken to the prison camp just outside a village, Aang notices the poor condition of the village and its people. They are shoved through a gateway of a tall metal fence.

Fire Nation Prison guard	Move. You, too.

In the prison yard, there are men on the ground, weary and defeated. The earthbending boy has reunited with his father.

Earthbending boy	Dad!
Earthbending boy	This is my father.
Earthbending father	Hello.
Sokka	That's the Fire Nation's plan, suppress all other bending.
Aang	How did this happen to your village?
Earthbending father	Fire Nation sent soldiers. We fought them and defeated them. Then they sent their machines, huge machines made of metal. There was nothing we could do. Those who could not bend were allowed to live in peace, if we were imprisoned.
Aang	Earthbenders! Why are you acting this way? You are powerful and amazing people! You don't need to live like this! There is earth right beneath your feet. The ground ... is an extension of who you are!

The earthbenders are dismissive and non-responsive

Aang	If the Avatar had returned ... would that mean anything to you?
Earth Kingdom prisoner	The Avatar is dead. If he was here, he would protect us.
Aang	My name is Aang ... and I am the Avatar. [Unhoods himself to reveal his airbending tattoos.] I ran away, but I'm back now. It's time for you to stop doing this!
Fire Nation prison guard	The Avatar would have to be an airbender. Are you an airbender, boy?

Katara angrily pushes the soldier away.

Katara	Leave him alone!

The prison guard was furious, then tries to grab Katara, but Aang uses airbending to push him away

Fire Nation head prison guard	How is he doing that?
Aang	I don't want to hurt anyone.
Fire Nation head prison guard	All airbenders should be dead. Kill him! Firebenders, positions!
Sokka	Okay! Everybody can help us now!

The earthbending boy throws a pebble behind the lead soldier; he turns and bends a flame from the nearby fire pit at the boy. The father raises an earth barrier to protect his son. The other earthbenders watch the event unfold and rise with renewed sense of hope.

Katara	Don't be afraid!

Seeking to restore order, the lead soldier with another firebender launches a large flame toward the father and the boy, but it is blocked by a larger barrier, which six earthbenders raise in unison. Another earthbender raises a rock and accelerates it at the other soldier, and earth-blocks a flame attack from the lead soldier. Sokka takes down the lead soldier while Aang takes out another. After a few more airbending moves from Aang and a boomerang attack thrown by Sokka, the remaining soldiers retreat. Outside the prison, Aang takes out a few more soldiers in the village. After everything is settled, the villagers break open a shed holding all tools related to bending.

Old man of Kyoshi Town	They took away any tools related to bending.

Momo goes in the shed and knocks over a waterbending scroll. A villager picks up the scroll and gave it to Katara.

Kyoshi villager	The Fire Nation took this scroll from a member of your Water Tribe.
Katara	A waterbending scroll. This is rare. My mom told me about these.
Aang is taken to the statue of Avatar Kyoshi
Old man of Kyoshi Town	This was you when you were born an earthbender, two lifetimes ago. You came to our village. Avatar Kyoshi loved games.
Aang	I do, too. I mean, I still do.
Aang later met with Sokka and Katara.
Sokka	A lot of the villages in this part of the Earth Kingdom are occupied by the Fire Nation, like this village was. They prey on the weakest towns and villages. We should go visit some of these towns, Aang.
Aang	I need to tell you something.
Katara	What is it, Aang?
Aang	I ran away before they trained me to be the Avatar. I don't know how to bend the other elements.
Katara	Why did you run away?
Aang	The day they told me I was the Avatar, they said I could never have a normal life, that I could never have a family. They said it cannot work with the responsibilities of the Avatar.
Katara	Why can't the Avatar have a family?
Aang	I asked that! They said that's the sacrifice the Avatar always has to make.
Sokka	Okay. So, what if we found you teachers. Teachers to teach you bending? Which element would you have to learn first?
Aang	Water. Water comes after air in the cycle. Air, water, earth, fire.
Sokka	But there are really powerful benders in the Northern Water Tribe. My dad told me about it before he left. It's led by a princess because her father died. There are teachers there, but all the way on the other side of the world.
Aang	We can get there on Appa.
Sokka	That's what I was thinking. And maybe we can stop in the villages on the way, start a change in The War in these small villages. Should we try it?
Aang	Yes, we should.

The team of Aang, Sokka, Katara, Momo and Appa, set out on the journey to the north. Along the way they visit the villages, where Aang announces the Avatar had returned. In villages that were still occupied by Fire Nation soldiers, Aang uses his airbending to defeat them and liberate the village from their grip.
Meanwhile, Zuko and two soldiers, disguised as travelers of the Earth Kingdom, visit the first village Aang liberated. They also enter the former prison camp and look around.



Act II (b), The Blue Spirit

Katara	[Narrating.] The scroll we had was proving to be helpful. Aang was practicing, but for some reason, he was having trouble with waterbending. We moved from town to town in the Earth Kingdom. We tried to stay out of sight, but Sokka became concerned we were being followed.

On Zhao's flagship, a soldier enters the war room and whispers some information to Zhao. Later, at the Fire Nation palace, Zhao meets with Ozai.

Zhao	Sire, I have good news. As you know, I conducted a raid on the Great Library, which most said didn't exist.
Ozai	Get on with it.
Zhao	I found scrolls in the library. We are deciphering them. But I believe they may contain information as to where the Ocean and Moon Spirits live in this world. With this information, we could bring down the Northern Water Tribe city, we could show the world the true strength of fire.
Ozai	I am pleased. Well, Commander Zhao, are the rumors true or not?
Zhao	Our spies have discovered someone claiming to be the Avatar. They describe him as just a boy. We should set a trap for this person. We have many Earth Kingdom people under our control. I can leave soldiers hidden in certain locations.
Ozai	And my son?
Zhao	He had his chance. He missed it.
Ozai	Let's hope, for your sake, my son doesn't find this person first and he turns out to be the Avatar. He would return as a hero and, for all purposes, be your superior.
Zhao	Well, I suppose it's a race, then.

At the Fire Nation Colony Fifteen located in the Northern Earth Kingdom, Zuko sat with his uncle Iroh sat in a tea shop, with his face hidden by the hood of his cloak to avoid being recognized.

Zuko	We're close, Uncle. They've been moving farther and farther north. We're catching them.
Iroh	There are a lot of pretty girls in this town, Zuko. You could fall in love here. We could settle down here, and you could have a blessed life. We don't have to continue this, Zuko.
Zuko	I'll show you why we must, Uncle. Hey. Hey. Little one, come here.
Zuko	You look like a very smart boy. Tell me what you know about the prince, the Fire Lord's son.
Teahouse Child	He did something wrong.
Zuko	He spoke out of turn to a general, in defense of some of his friends who were going to be sacrificed in a battle.
Teahouse Child	Then Prince Zuko was sentenced to an Agni Ki duel, but when he showed up, it was his father he was to fight.
Zuko	That's right.
Teahouse Child	He would not fight his father.
Zuko	Then his father mocked him and said, "I should bring your sister up here to beat you."
Teahouse child	Then the father burnt his son ... to teach him a lesson. [Leaves.]
Zuko	[Turning to his uncle.] We'll catch him soon, Uncle. Then we can think about the pretty girls.
At the shore of a sparking lake beside a forest, Katara and Aang practiced waterbending while Sokka tended to a campfire nearby.
Katara	Aang ... try to keep your wrist bent, like it's showing.
Katara	What's wrong? You've really been distracted today.
Aang	I saw Sokka's maps. We're near the Northern Air Temple. Do you think it would be okay if I just visited there and came back? I'd be back in less than a day.

Later, Katara filled in Sokka in on what Aang wanted to do.

Sokka	Why?
Katara	He had a vision at the Southern Air Temple prayer field. He talked to a Dragon Spirit who he thinks can help us. He thinks if he goes to another spiritual place, he can get back to the Spirit World.
Sokka	I don't think that's a good idea. We started a rebellion. Try to talk him out of it.

Aang continued practicing waterbending in the dark, while Sokka and Katara were sleeping. He managed to raise the three short pillars of water. As he closes his eyes concentrating, ripples and waves began to form on the lake. He remembers Gyatso giving lessons to him and the other students in the open field and then images of skeletal remains he saw earlier. When he opened his eyes, he was surprised to see the result of his lack of control over waterbending.

Aang	I can't do this. I need help.

Convinced that Aang needed help immediately from the Dragon Spirit, he woke up Appa to head over to the Northern Air Temple. Sokka and Katara woke up and saw him took off. She assured Sokka that Aang will back in a day, but Sokka was concerned the Fire Nation might catch him.

Sokka	I guess your talk didn't work.
Katara	He'll be back in a day.
Sokka	The Fire Nation is following us. If we make a wrong move, they'll catch him.

Appa lands at the Northern Air Temple. As Aang makes his way in the temple ruins, he finds an old man.

Old man in temple	Who are you? Why, it cannot be! I've heard stories. Are you?
Aang	My name is Aang.
Old man in temple	I cannot believe I've lived to see your return. I'm an earth villager, but I visit these temple remains often.
Aang	The Fire Nation destroyed this temple. They have ruined everything.
Old man in temple	No, no, no, not everything. You know, there's a hidden chamber of statues I think you, of all people, should see. [Leads Aang to a hidden chamber of statues of past Avatars.] These are all the Avatars. These are the reincarnations of you over the years. The Avatar Roku was your last life. Now, how did the airbenders know you were the Avatar, little one?
Aang	They gave me a test. They put 1,000 toys in front of me and asked me to choose four. They said I chose the same four objects that belonged to the previous Avatars. That's when they told me I could have no family. Told me I had a responsibility to the Four Nations. There's a ceremony when everyone bows to me. That's when I accept my role as the Avatar. But when everyone bowed ... I didn't bow back.
Old man in temple	You seem like a nice young man. You really do. You will forgive me, won't you?
Aang	For what?
Old man in temple	For luring you down here.

Confused, Aang turns to see him surrounded by Fire Nation archers hiding behind the statues.

Old man in temple	I have lived in poverty because of your absence, Avatar. So you will understand my actions today.
O
ther Fire Nation soldiers poured into the chamber – one of them passed the old man a pouch of money as a reward. Unable to escape, Aang resigned himself to surrender.
Aang is later hung from chains in a prayer room in the Northern Air Temple. Aang closes his eyes and entered the Spirit World.

Old man in temple	[Echo.] I have lived in poverty because of your absence, Avatar.

Aang finds his way back to cave and meets the Dragon Spirit again.

Dragon Spirit	I have seen a vision of the moon turning red. The Fire Nation has stolen knowledge of us from the Great Library. They are planning to misuse this knowledge.
Aang	I will stop them.
Dragon Spirit	You must go to the Northern Water Tribe. If they take that city, more will suffer and die, as your airbenders have. You must go now
Aang	Will I stop them?

Aang is forcibly pulled from the Spirit World, being woken up by Zhao.

Zhao	Wake up, young man. My name is Commander Zhao. I set this trap for you. Don't worry, I'm not gonna kill you. Besides, you'd just be reborn again, and then the search would continue. So where have you been all this time? And how is it that you're still a boy? I understand that when you freed that handful of towns, you were very impressive, but ... you only used airbending against my soldiers. Now, why is that?

Later, a Fire Nation tank rolls on the bridge that connects to the temple. A blue-masked figure hitches a ride by grabbing onto its undercarriage. Zhao addresses his assembly of soldiers in the courtyard.

Zhao	The Fire Lord and I have a plan to ensure our reign and the downfall of our enemies. I am sending a personal message to the Fire Lord, informing him that the once feared Avatar is our prisoner and no threat to our might.

The figure heads toward the prayer room, stealthily taking down the soldiers posted along the way there. He enters the prayer room.

Aang	Who are you?

The figure pulls his dual swords about the strike.

Aang	Wait! Don't ...!

The figure severs the chains. Aang falls down on the floor and holds up his chained hands.

Aang	Stop!

The figure cuts the cuffs off Aang's hand. He gives Aang's staff back then motions Aang to follow him. Zhao and his assistant head toward the prayer room when he discovers the downed soldiers.

Zhao	Fools.

His assistant quickly runs back upstairs to alert the other soldiers.

Zhao's assistant	Close the inner gates! The Avatar has escaped!

Aang uses airbending to knock two soldiers block his path. He enters the temple courtyard with the blue-masked figure, referred by the soldiers as the Blue Spirit. They are surrounded by many Fire Nation soldiers.

Fire Nation soldier #1	Lock down the gate!
Fire Nation soldier #2	Lock down all the gates!

A fire attack from behind forces them to evade and split up, fighting the soldiers on the opposite sides on the courtyard. Aang ends up in the practice area.

Fire Nation soldier	To the main post!
Aang	This was their practice area.
Fire Nation Soldier	Go again!

Aang uses the airbending practice area to take out the soldiers, then leaps out of the courtyard and ran on the stepping pillars that the soldiers are unable to follow. Aang prepares to fly out using his staff-glider but seeing the Blue Spirit still fending off the soldiers by himself, Aang flies back to fight alongside him.

Zhao	Do not kill the Avatar! He will just be reborn again!

The Blue Spirit quickly grabs Aang and threateningly holds his sword at Aang's throat.

Zhao	Why are you doing this? Who are you?

Zhao notices a human mouth behind the blue mask.

Zhao	Open the gates. Let them out.

The soldiers remained at the courtyard while the Blue Spirit led Aang across the bridge. Zhao head up on a high balcony.

Lead Archer	Is it some kind of Spirit, Commander?
Zhao	Not at all. [Turns his head to the Lead Archer.] Do it.

At the end of the bridge, Zhao's archer shoots down the Blue Spirit with single arrow. The soldiers rush across the bridge to capture them. Aang discovers the unconscious Blue Spirit was Zuko. He uses airbending to pull in the fog and mask their getaway.

Zhao	What is this?

Once the fog clears, Aang and the Blue Spirit are nowhere to be found.
Aang takes care of Zuko till the next morning, then left Zuko still unconscious by the camp-fire in the forest, leaping from tree to tree.

A few days later, Zhao arrives at the Fire Nation palace, being summoned into the throne room.

Ozai	And how did he escape?
Zhao	I fear that your son is not only incompetent, but also a traitor. Of course, I cannot prove this, sire.
Ozai	You think ... my son is this person the soldiers are calling the Blue Spirit.
Zhao	Yes.

Back in the Northern Earth Kingdom, Iroh relaxes and receives a foot message from an earth villager woman when Zuko walks past him.

Iroh	Zhao's men were searching the coast, looking for you. They also searched the ship. I told them you went on vacation with a girl. Where were you for the past four days?
Zuko	Nowhere. We have to keep moving. The Avatar is traveling again.
Iroh	Take rest first. It looks like you went through a great deal. When you wake, we'll have tea together before we start the engines.
Ozai	[Voice-over.] Do not harm my son. Leave him to his isolation.
Zhao	[Voice-over.] You have my word, sire. I will not harm him.

As Zuko lay down on his bed in his ship, he notices something hissing near the torch on his wall. Zuko dashes out just before the ship explodes into a huge, orange fireball. Iroh moves in to protect the woman from the blast as he cries out to Zuko.

Iroh	Zuko!

Cut to Appa (carrying Aang and the others) swimming toward the Northern Water Tribe.

Ozai	[Voice-over.] And what of the Avatar?

Cut back to Ozai's throne room.

Zhao	We assume he has rejoined with his supporters. It has been confirmed that he's traveling north. It is my strong belief that he is traveling to the Northern Water Tribe.

Aang and the others find waterbenders practicing in the open water. Sokka waves at them. They are led to the city of the Northern Water Tribe.

Zhao	[Voice-over.] I believe the child Avatar has only knowledge of his birth element, air. I believe he is trying to learn in the discipline of water. He's gone to seek out someone in the Northern Water Tribe, where they have lived beyond our reach and openly practice waterbending.

Aang and the others are led into the city, the entranced seals shut behind them with waterbending.



Act III, The Siege of the North

Katara	[Narrating.] We arrived at the Northern Water Tribe. We presented ourselves to the royal court. My brother and the princess became friends right away. Aang showed them he was the last airbender, and was accepted to train with the master. The city knew our arrival would bring great danger. And they prepared for war they knew would come in the ensuing weeks.

Pakku lays out their defense strategy to Yue, with Sokka by her side.

Pakku	The city was designed to withstand any assault. If we keep them to the courtyard and the marketplace till night falls, where we have the advantage, we will succeed. If we let too many of them into the city, their sheer numbers could overwhelm us. As many fires in this city should be put out as possible when the alarm sounds. We want to minimize their bender sources. I must assign a guard to be with you at all times, Princess. Your presence is our inspiration.
Sokka	I'll do it. That's me. I'll be her guard. Nothing will happen to her.
Pakku	I had a feeling you might volunteer.

At the Fire Nation palace.

Ozai	I've heard no word of my son for quite some time. Do you know where he is?
Zhao	I've not heard of anything, sire. I'm sure word of him will come to us soon.
Ozai	The Northern Water Tribe benders are given their strength by the Moon and Ocean Spirits. They will be difficult to defeat. Now, if for some reason the Spirits were not involved, that would be different. What have you learned from the stolen scrolls?
Zhao	We have deciphered the location of the Moon and Ocean Spirits.
Ozai	It is our destiny ... to have found this information, Zhao. Eliminate the Spirits. Take the city and we will have thwarted the Avatar in the process.

The Fire Nation fleet is later seen leaving the ports, heading out to the city.
Katara and Aang has attend a waterbending class taught by Pakku.

Pakku	Water is what?
Students	The flowing element. The element of change.
Pakku	To master water, you must release your emotions, wherever they may lead you. Water teaches us acceptance. Let your emotions flow like water. [To Aang.] Aang, would you like to spar? You haven't sparred in a few days.

Pakku encases Aang in an icy prison; Aang gracefully waterbends the ice away. Pakku sends him three water balls, which Aang successful catches in mid-air and disperses.

Pakku	Now, use offense, Aang

Aang attempts an offensive move as instructed, but he only manages to raise droplets of water and inadvertently raises the waters in the nearby canals. Aang stops, realizing his still lack control over his incredible waterbending ability, as Pakku and the students watch in astonishment.
On the Fire Nation flagship that leads the rest of fleet, Iroh meets with Zhao on the upper deck.

Zhao	General Iroh, I'm glad you could accept my invitation to join us on this historic event.
Iroh	Your invitation was most gracious.
Zhao	You are a gifted strategist. No one can argue that. Your failure in the Hundred Day Siege of Ba Sing Se won't be held against you. Your son died in that siege, didn't he?
Iroh	Yes, he did.
Zhao	Again, I offer my condolences on your nephew burning to death in that terrible accident.
Iroh	Thank you.

Sokka and Yue spend some time enjoy each other's company.

Yue	I've loved spending these weeks with you, Sokka.
Sokka	Me, too.
Yue	Should we see what the ocean is doing today?

They head over to the fort walls for the ocean view.

Yue	When there is some safety for all of us, I will come visit our sister city in the Southern Water Tribe and spend some time in your home.
Sokka	That would be great. But I warn you ... my grandmother will ask you a lot of questions.
Yue	What might she ask me?
Sokka	She'll say, "Why is your hair white, young lady? You look very odd."
Yue	I would say to your grandmother, my hair is white because when I was born, I was not awake. My mother and father could not get me to make a sound or move. So they prayed for days to the Moon Spirit and dipped me into the sacred waters. My parents said that my hair turned white then and life poured into me.
Sokka	Wow. You didn't tell me that.
Yue	You didn't ask me. Only your grandmother did.

Iroh went below deck and met with Zuko, who was still alive.

Iroh	I'm sure Zhao was the one who ordered the attack on you.
Zuko	Any problems?
Iroh	We have arrived at the Northern Water Tribe's stronghold. They believe the boy is there.
Zuko	Why do you seem upset, Uncle?
Iroh	Zhao has no sacredness. Are you sure you want to be here?
Zuko	I will not be allowed to live in peace until I bring the Avatar to my father! Is that not clear to you?

Aang and Katara practice their waterbending forms when the black ashes fall all over the city.

Yue	[Confused.] What is this?
Sokka	Yue ... the Fire Nation is here.

The ashes came from the burning engines of the Fire Nation ships. At the rear of Zhao's flagship, Zuko wearing a white camouflage suit stepped into a small boat.

Iroh	Now be sure to keep your uniform closed up to your neck. And remember, your Chi can warm you.
Zuko	I know, Uncle.
Iroh	Be safe.

Zuko heads out near the shore of the stronghold, then dive in. He finds a spot underneath the city with thin layer of ice, then generates heat from his chi to melt the spot and breaks through the surface, into an unoccupied room.
Sokka takes Aang into the balcony room, to see Yue, who oversees the Fire Nation armada with Katara.

Katara	Aang needs to ask you something.
Aang	I have to talk to the Dragon Spirit. He can help me defeat the Fire Nation. Is there a spiritual place where I can meditate?
Yue	There is a very spiritual place. The city was built around this place. But we must hurry.

Yue leads Aang, Katara, and Sokka to the place. Zuko notices them from the rooftops, and follows them to an entrance into the side of a icy hill. Inside, they step into a spiritual cave with an oasis pond. In the middle of the pond is a tree with a ground path leading to it. Momo reaches into the pond to touch one of the two fish, one black and the other white.

Aang	Momo, be nice.

Momo scampers and flies away.

Aang	To get your airbending tattoos, you have to meditate for long periods of time without losing focus. Some of the great monks can meditate for four days.

As Aang sits down to meditate near the tree, two fish swirl together in a circle and glow in their insides.

Yue	I have to get back.
Sokka	I'll take you.
Katara	I'll stay with him.

Sokka escorts Yue back while Katara stays with Aang as he meditates into a trance.

Katara	Aang? Aang, can you hear me? I knew you were real. I always knew you'd return.
Zuko	Me, too.
Katara	The Fire Lord's son. You took him from our village.

Zuko sets his torch down to set the grass on fire, as Katara takes a defensive stance. Zuko sends out a fire blast, which she takes out with two large stream with water from the pond. With the second blast, Katara takes it out with a single stream. Zuko is surprised and impressed of her waterbending ability.

Zuko	Who are you?
Katara	My name is Katara, and I'm the only waterbender left in the Southern Water Tribe.

Zuko then firebends a curved blast and a straight blast. Overwhelmed with the complexity of Zuko's attack, she deflects the curved blast but is knocked hard against the tree with the other blast.
As the large city bell was rung, the Northern Water Tribe residents hurriedly seek for shelter all over the city. Soldiers were seen lining up on the fort walls, overlooking the large Fire Nation fleet nearing its attack range. As Pakku gives out the battle cry, the soldiers rattled the end of their spears against the icy floor for morale.

Water Tribe civilian #1	Go for the children.
Water Tribe civilian #2	Yes.

Zuko rests Katara's unconscious body next to the tree and checks her condition.

Zuko	I'm not allowed to go home without him.

Northern Water Tribe soldiers and waterbenders are seen lining up on the fort walls, overlooking the large Fire Nation fleet nearing its attack range. As Pakku gives out the battle cry, the soldiers rattle the end of their spears against the icy floor for morale.
Iroh enters the war room on Zhao's ship.

Iroh	The waterbenders get power from the moon. They will get stronger as the day comes to an end.
Zhao	General Iroh, I've been keeping a secret.
Iroh	And what is that?
Zhao	In my raid of the Great Library earlier this year, I found a scroll that tells the location of the Ocean and Moon Spirits.
Iroh	To meet a Spirit would be a great honor.
Zhao	Well, I hope I can give you that honor.

The Fire Nation invasion of the Northern Water Tribe stronghold was fully underway. A firebender riding Komodo-Rhino stepped off the ship's platform and scaled up the icy fort walls. At the top, the firebender uses the fiery metal spheres catapulted from the ship to blast the city below. Spinning drills break through the surface at many locations within the city, where soldiers emerge from the sea below.
Sokka came back to the spiritual place with Yue, and found Katara lying unconscious near the tree. He woke her up.

Sokka	What happened?
Katara	Prince Zuko's here in the city. He took Aang again.

Elsewhere, Zuko places Aang down in a storage room in the stronghold, still in trance with his hands bound with rope. Zuko peers out the window, looking down the battle taking place below.

Zuko	We'll just wait till everyone's fighting everyone. Then in the night, we'll slip out.

Back to the point when Aang entered the Spirit World

Katara	[Voice-over.] Aang, can you hear me? I knew you were real. I always knew you'd return.

Aang sees the lanterns which leads him back to the cave again.

Aang	Hello! Hello! [Enters the cave and finds the Dragon Spirit inside.] Please, tell me how to beat the Fire Nation!
Dragon Spirit	You are not dealing with the loss of your people, and your responsibility for their deaths. You are stopping yourself from grieving. You are angry. You must let this go. As the Avatar, you are not meant to hurt others. [Slithers past Aang and out of the cave, but then peers back at Aang.] Use the ocean. Show them the power of water. Go! Do this now.

The Dragon spreads its mighty wings and lifts itself into the sky, as Aang leaves his trance.

Zuko	[Voice-over.] My sister Azula was always the special one. She was a firebending prodigy.

Aang finds himself hand bound in the storage room, and overhears Zuko talking while he is still looking out the window.

Zuko	My father loves her. He can't even look at me sometimes. He says I'm like my mother.

Aang takes off, leaping over barrels, with Zuko chasing right behind him. He firebends the flames from the torches to take Aang down, in the process blasting away items in the room.
Just outside the stronghold, a firebender concentrates a large flame through a nozzle on a ship to breach the fort wall. He succeeds in creating a hole, which is large enough for Fire Nation soldiers and Komodo rhino-riders to freely enter the city. Master Pakku waterbends the soldiers in the courtyard. Cut back to the flagship.

Iroh	I advise that you pull back your men soon. They will be trapped in the city when the moon's power comes out.
Zhao	Do not worry about the moon's power, General Iroh.
Iroh	Why should you not be worried about the moon's power?
Zhao	Because your brother, Fire Lord Ozai, and I have decided it is in our best interests to kill the Moon Spirit.
Iroh	What?

Zuko searches for Aang hiding in the storage room. His hands now free, Aang uses airbending to distract Zuko and tried to escape. The situation escalates to a fight, later with firebending and airbending.
Katara follows Sokka and Yue back into the city, with the battle ongoing.

Katara	Calm down. We'll find him.

Katara then sees the flames illuminating from the window of the storage room from the city below.
As the fight between Aang and Zuko turns into a standoff, they notice that room is rumbling. The water in the barrels begin to shake, then spirals to Zuko encasing him in ice. Aang turns to see Katara, who completes her waterbending move.

Katara	Are you okay? Did the Spirits tell you anything?
Aang	Yes. The Dragon Spirit talked to me. I know what to do.
Katara	Aang, we have to go.

Katara then left the room with Sokka and Yue. Aang peered out the window was astonished at the battle in the city. Before leaving the room, he melted the ice around Zuko's head so Zuko can breathe.

Aang	You won't be killed by waterbenders if you stay hidden here. [Walking to the doorway, he turns toward Zuko.] We could be friends, you know.

Zhao and Iroh enter the Water Tribe stronghold through the breach, flanked by Fire Nation soldiers. He uses the scroll from the Great Library to lead his men and Iroh to where they need to go.

Zhao	They're getting stronger. This is a scroll from the Great Library. This is our map. Our world is going to change soon, gentlemen.

Some soldiers approach the civilians.

Fire Nation soldier	Right there and right there.

The soldiers step back, seeing Appa growling at them.

Elsewhere, Aang heads toward the courtyard with Sokka, Yue and Katara, when he notices Zhao heading somewhere with the scroll in his hand.

Aang	See where they're going! I'll go join the fight!

Aang joins the fight in the main courtyard. Meanwhile, back at the storage room, Zuko uses his chi-heat to melt the ice and free himself. Elsewhere, Zhao and Iroh end up at the same spiritual place where Aang meditated.

Zhao	They are called many names: Yin and Yang, "push" and "pull". May I introduce you to the mysterious Ocean and Moon Spirits? [Scoops the white fish into his pouch.] Why do Spirits take the form of such benign things? It leaves them so vulnerable.
Iroh	To teach man kindness and humility.

Zhao prepares to kill the Moon Spirit.

Iroh	Commander Zhao, there are certain things humankind should not tamper with. The Spirits and the Spirit World is one of them.

Just then, Katara, Sokka, and Yue burst into the spiritual place.

Yue	What are you doing here?
Iroh	Stop, Zhao. The world will go out of balance. Everyone will be hurt.
Zhao	The Fire Nation, is, too powerful ... to worry about children's superstitions, General Iroh.
Iroh	Commander Zhao, don't.
Zhao	We are now the gods!

Zhao overcomes his hesitation and stabbed the fish with his dagger.

Iroh	No!

Yue collapses onto the grass, as if she was the one who was struck. Outside, pain shoots through Aang's head. The moon slowly turns red, casting a sickly crimson glow over the Northern city. The waterbenders lose their Moon enhanced powers.

Fire Nation soldier	All men, battle stations!

Cut back to the spiritual place.

Zhao	You are too soft, General Iroh.

In rage, Iroh creates large fires from his hands.

Fire Nation soldier	He's making fire out of nothing!

Zhao, unable to comprehend or combat this great power, turns and flees from the spiritual place, along with his men. Iroh lowers his hands and his flames die down and disappear.
With the Moon power gone, more Fire Nation soldiers pour into city through three breaches now made on the fort walls.

Water Tribe soldier	They're breaching the wall!
Water Tribe soldier	To the front!

Aang looks at the losing battle surrounding him, as the Dragon Spirit's words are heard again.

Dragon Spirit	[Echo.] As the Avatar, you are not meant to hurt others. You must show them the power of water.

At the spiritual place, Yue and the others grieved for the loss of the Moon spirit.

Yue	All is lost.
Iroh	You have been anointed by the Moon Spirit.
Yue	He gave me life when I was a child.
Iroh	Then there is still a chance. You can give your life back for the Spirit's.
Sokka	Don't listen to him, he's Fire Nation.
Iroh	Nothing is ever truly lost.
Yue	Is it mine to give back, if I choose?
Iroh	There are reasons each of us are born. We have to find those reasons.
Yue	This was the reason I was born.
Sokka	Yue, please.
Yue	There is no love without sacrifice.
Sokka	Yue, what are you doing? You don't know what will happen.
Yue	I believe my life force will leave my body and return to the Moon Spirit.
Sokka	And then what?
Yue	My soul will no longer exist in this form.
Sokka	Please don't do this. There must be another way. I can't let you do this. I'm supposed to protect you.
Yue	My people are dying, Sokka. Those who are in charge of others have a responsibility. It is time we show the Fire Nation we believe in our beliefs as much as they believe in theirs.
Sokka	But Yue ...
Yue	I'm scared. Don't make me any more scared. I will miss you more than you know.

She gives Sokka a final kiss and enters the pond. As her life force leaves her to revive the Moon spirit, her white hair turns black. There is a pause in battle when the Moon reverts back to its natural glow. Iroh lifts her lifeless body out of the pond and lays her down on the grass. Distraught, Sokka cries over her lifeless body.
Zhao is on a bridge, seemingly in despair of his failure of killing the Moon, when Zuko steps out from the mist, walking toward him.

Zhao	I killed you.

Zuko prepares to duel Zhao when Iroh appears.

Iroh	Come away from him, nephew. There are too many soldiers now. They will never let you take the Avatar. We must leave immediately. He wants to fight you so he can capture you, Zuko. Walk away. [Zuko stands his ground, staring at Zhao with deadly intensity.] Come!

Zuko turns and walks back toward Iroh. As they walk away, the enraged Zhao bends a large double-spiral fire attack to them. Iroh quickly steps in front of Zuko and redirects the flames to sides, shielding him and Zuko.

Iroh	You stand alone. And that has always been your great mistake.

They leave Zhao standing alone on the bridge. The flames had attracted the attention of four waterbenders, now blocking Zhao's path off the bridge. Outnumbered, Zhao had no way of escaping and no chance of defeating them, especially with the return of the Moon's power. Refusing to surrender, Zhao provoked the waterbenders by bending a fire shot that barely hit any of the waterbenders. He then took off his cloak and waited to be finished off. Four large stream of water bent from the river below engulfed Zhao into a water sphere, drowning him.
Aang races toward the fort wall, using waterbending to trap and stop Fire Nation soldiers along the way. He sends an airbending blast through the courtyard, opening a path through the battle forces, leading him right to the wall. At the top, he looks out at the vast Fire Nation fleet in the ocean.

Pakku	[Voice-over.] Water teaches us acceptance. Let your emotions flow like water.

He recalls images of his life with Gyatso and his friends, and then the fateful event where everyone bowed to him but ran away instead of bowing back. Freeing himself of his guilt, Aang used with the Ocean's power to push a massive body of water up against the fort wall, and Moon's power to pull it toward the sky. His eyes and tattoos glowed bluish-white as he unleashes "the power of water". The battle paused again at the incredible feat of waterbending. The Fire Nation soldiers in the city tried to retreat through a breach but it was blocked by the water. Aang bent the water toward the Fire Nation fleet but kept it hovering threateningly above them. Knowing that the water could easily crush the fleet, the Fire Nation accepted defeat and turned away. Aang bent the water back into the ocean and watched the fleet in retreat.

Katara	Aang?

Katara hugs Aang as he was cheered from the city below. She and Sokka help an exhausted Aang down the stairs into the courtyard. Aang sees the entire Northern Water Tribe waiting for him. They all kneel and bow before him. The remaining Fire Nation soldiers left in the city also bow, in awe of his power and moved by his show of mercy.

Katara	They want you to be their Avatar, Aang. We all do.

Katara and Sokka bow alongside the others. Finally accepting his role as the Avatar, Aang bows back.



Epilogue

The story closes with Ozai's exposition at the Fire Nation place, directed to his daughter Azula, who kneels before him.

Ozai	Our forces in the Northern Water Tribe have failed to take the city. General Zhao was killed in battle and my brother has become a traitor. My son's proven himself a failure. Now, Sozin's Comet is returning in three years. It will give all firebenders the ability of the highest firebenders, the ability to use their own Chi to create fire. That is the day we will win this war and prove the Fire Nation's dominance. Now you must stop the Avatar from mastering earth and fire. You must give us the time to get to that day. Do you accept this unspeakably important task I'm putting in your hands?
Azula	I do, Father.
