We have suffered many a disaster, but we have never let the differences between our principles get in the way of the truth, of bounty, of peace, and of love. Our kingdoms have been weathered, and it is true that we have lost many, but we have gained sevenfold from our shortcomings, and we will continue to withstand the test of time.</br></br>The Portal aims to tell the story of our nation’s crown.
